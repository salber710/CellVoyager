genes-15-00298.pdf,"The paper addresses a significant knowledge gap in the understanding of late-stage human lung development, particularly at the neonatal stage. While animal models, primarily murine, have provided extensive insights into the mechanisms controlling cell diversity and function in the developing mammalian lung, the direct applicability of these findings to human physiology, especially during the critical transition from fetal to neonatal life, is not fully understood. The human lung is a highly complex organ, comprising over 40 distinct cell types whose coordinated interactions are essential for proper development, including lineage specification, proliferation, differentiation, morphogenesis, and injury repair. Disruptions in these intricate developmental processes can contribute to the early-life origins of lung disease.

Current molecular characterization of human lung development has largely focused on earlier fetal stages, with a paucity of data describing the cellular landscape of the newborn human lung. This limitation has been partly due to the challenges in accessing high-quality human tissue suitable for molecular analysis. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) Molecular Atlas of Lung Development Program (LungMAP) was established to overcome these hurdles by creating a comprehensive structural, cellular, and molecular atlas of both human and mouse lungs across various developmental stages. LungMAP serves as a crucial repository for multi-omics datasets and computational tools, facilitating research in pulmonary development.

Historically, many high-throughput molecular studies on lung development utilized whole lung tissue, which obscured cell-type-specific activities and interactions. The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has revolutionized the ability to perform transcriptomic mapping of individual cells. This allows for an unprecedented understanding of cellular heterogeneity, the identification of distinct cell states, and the elucidation of molecular mechanisms within complex biological systems like the developing lung. scRNA-seq also enables unbiased comparisons across different species. Recognizing its power, consortia like the Human Cell Atlas have prioritized the characterization of lung tissue at single-cell resolution. This technology has been increasingly applied to identify both known and novel cell populations and to assess changes in cellular composition and gene expression during lung health, development, and disease. This study leverages these advancements to explore the cellular and molecular intricacies of the newborn human lung, with a focus on creating a cellular atlas and understanding differences in maturation states of various cell types.","['Initial scRNA-seq Characterization of Newborn Human Lung Cells', 'Cellular Annotation and Marker Gene Identification in Newborn Human Lung scRNA-seq Data', 'Processing and Characterization of a Reference Postnatal Mouse Lung scRNA-seq Dataset', 'Cross-Species Integration of Newborn Human and Postnatal Mouse Lung scRNA-seq Data', 'Cellular Annotation and Marker Gene Identification in the Integrated Human-Mouse scRNA-seq Dataset', 'Computational Estimation of Human Lung Cell Developmental Maturity Using a Mouse Lung Reference Trajectory', 'Differential Gene Expression Analysis to Identify Markers of Maturation States in Human Matrix Fibroblasts']","[{'title': 'Initial scRNA-seq Characterization of Newborn Human Lung Cells', 'description': 'Single-cell suspensions from two one-day-old newborn human lungs were processed.

sciimmunol.adn3954.pdf,"Gamma-delta (γδ) T cells represent a unique T cell subset that is produced in the thymus and, unlike conventional major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted alpha-beta (αβ) T cells, can directly seed peripheral tissues. These cells are capable of responding to diverse microbial stimuli independently of MHC-peptide recognition. Studies in mice have shown that developmental 'waves' of γδ T cells localize to barrier sites during embryogenesis, playing crucial roles in protective immunity, homeostasis, and tissue repair. A key characteristic of mouse γδ T cells is their tissue-specific distribution, often dictated by particular variable segments of the T cell receptor gamma (TCRγ) chain, which endows them with site-specific functions from birth.

In humans, γδ T cells are also generated during gestation, subsequently seeding tissues and being detectable in the blood. They have been implicated in immune responses against tumors and certain pathogens. Human γδ T cell subsets are primarily delineated by the TCR delta (TCRδ) chain, with two major subsets being Vδ1 and Vδ2, alongside rarer populations expressing Vδ3-8. Generally, tissues show an enrichment for Vδ1 cells, whereas peripheral blood predominantly contains Vδ2 cells, which often coexpress Vγ9. Much of the current understanding of human γδ T cell subsets is derived from studies of peripheral blood and the thymus. Human Vδ2Vγ9+ cells are often described as innate-like due to their capacity for direct effector and cytolytic functions originating from the thymus. In contrast, Vδ1+ cells typically exhibit more adaptive-like characteristics, such as variable effector functions, diverse TCR repertoires, and the ability to undergo clonal expansion in response to antigens. The composition of γδ T cell subsets in human blood changes with age, shifting from a higher proportion of Vδ1 cells at birth to a predominance of Vδ2 cells in older children and adults.

A significant gap in knowledge exists regarding the identity, maturation dynamics, and fate of human γδ T cells *within tissues* as individuals age, primarily due to the challenges in obtaining tissue samples across different life stages. The research group conducting this study has a history of investigating the human immune system in tissues by utilizing samples obtained from human organ donors of all ages, in collaboration with organ procurement organizations. These physiologically healthy samples permit the isolation of live cells for functional studies and high-dimensional single-cell profiling, enabling the study of immune cells across multiple tissues within an individual and providing insights into tissue-specific compartmentalization and adaptations. By integrating data from donors across a wide age range, from early life to adulthood, they aim to understand the development and maturation of tissue immune cells. For instance, they recently demonstrated that γδ T cells are present in human mucosal sites at birth, a time when αβ T cells are sparse, suggesting important roles for γδ T cells in early-life immunity. 

This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into human γδ T cells within blood, as well as mucosal and lymphoid tissues, sourced from organ donors and living blood donors spanning infancy to the ninth decade of life. The study employs high-dimensional methodologies, including phenotypic, transcriptional, and functional profiling, with the goal of elucidating how γδ T cell subsets exhibit site- and age-dependent variations in their composition, compartmentalization, functional capabilities, and dissemination patterns.","['scRNA-seq Data Generation and Initial Processing for Pediatric γδ T cells', 'Transcriptional Clustering, Functional Module Identification, and Vδ/Vγ Gene Usage Analysis of Pediatric γδ T cells', 'Acquisition and Preparation of Adult γδ T cell scRNA-seq Data for Comparative Analysis', 'Transcriptional Clustering, Functional Annotation, and Vδ/Vγ Gene Usage Analysis of Adult γδ T cells', 'Integrated scRNA-seq Analysis of Pediatric and Adult γδ T Cells for Functional State Annotation', 'Differential Gene Expression (DEG) Analysis on Integrated Pediatric and Adult γδ T Cell scRNA-seq Data']","[{'title': 'scRNA-seq Data Generation and Initial Processing for Pediatric γδ T cells', 'description': 'Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on sort-purified γδ T cells (CD45+CD3+TCRαβ-TCRγδ+) isolated from spleens, lungs, lung-associated lymph nodes (LLNs), jejuna (laminae propriae), and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of four pediatric donors aged 1 to 2 years.

s44161-025-00612-6.pdf,"Myocarditis, an inflammatory condition of the heart muscle characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, can arise from various causes, including viral infections like SARS-CoV-2 or, infrequently, following mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination. Despite its clinical significance, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive these different forms of myocarditis are not fully understood. COVID-19, primarily a respiratory illness, can lead to systemic and cardiovascular complications, with acute cardiac injury being a notable occurrence after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies have indicated a substantially increased risk of developing myocarditis post-COVID-19. In children and young adults, SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), where myocarditis is a prominent feature. Similarly, cardiac injury, although rare, has been observed after COVID-19 vaccination, particularly with mRNA vaccines. While direct viral damage to the myocardium by SARS-CoV-2 appears limited, the infection can provoke an intense systemic release of cytokines, potentially causing a secondary inflammatory response in the heart. Vaccine-associated myocardial inflammation has been described with features like systemic 'cytokinopathy', the presence of activated cytotoxic lymphocytes, or the induction of IL1-RA. Prior investigations using methods like immunohistochemistry on cardiac tissues have often pointed to a macrophage-dominated inflammatory infiltrate in myocarditis cases following both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. This study aims to elucidate the cardiac tissue responses at a cellular and molecular level in these distinct inflammatory cardiomyopathies.","['Cardiac Cell Atlas Generation and Single-Nucleus RNA Sequencing Data Processing', 'Identification and Annotation of Major Cardiac Cell Types', 'Major Cardiac Cell Type Compositional Analysis Across Patient Groups', 'Pseudo-bulk Differential Gene Expression Analysis in Cardiac Tissue', 'Myeloid Cell Subpopulation Characterization and Differential Analysis', 'Lymphoid Cell Subpopulation Characterization and Differential Analysis', 'Cardiomyocyte (CM) State Characterization and Gene Expression Analysis', 'Vascular Cell (Endothelial and Mural) State Characterization and Pathway Analysis', 'Fibroblast (FB) State Characterization and Gene Expression Analysis', 'Intercellular Communication Network Analysis', 'Analysis of MHC-I Pathway Gene Expression in Non-Immune and Specific Cardiac Cells']","[{'title': 'Cardiac Cell Atlas Generation and Single-Nucleus RNA Sequencing Data Processing', 'description': ""Nuclei were isolated from endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) from myocarditis patients (Non-COVID-19, Post-COVID-19, Post-Vaccination, MIS-C) and from control donor left ventricular (LV) tissue.

1-s2.0-S2666979X23000642-main.pdf,"The vertebrate retina is a complex, multi-layered neuronal tissue responsible for converting light into electrical signals transmitted to the brain. It comprises six major neuronal cell classes (rods, cones, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)) and several non-neuronal types like Müller glia. While the overall retinal structure is conserved across vertebrates, significant inter-species differences exist in cytoarchitecture, synaptic connections, and the number and types of cells within each class, particularly for amacrine and RGC types. This diversity suggests that findings from model organisms may not fully represent the human retina. The human retina itself is highly heterogeneous, containing an estimated 60 neuronal types whose abundances vary dramatically, with some types being exceedingly rare (e.g., certain RGCs constituting less than 0.05% of the total cell population). Previous single-cell transcriptomic studies have highlighted this heterogeneity, but a complete catalog of human retinal cell types, especially rare ones, requires extensive cell profiling and often targeted enrichment strategies. Beyond transcriptomics, understanding the epigenomic landscape at single-cell resolution is crucial for deciphering gene expression regulation dynamics and identifying regulatory elements, including non-coding variants associated with retinal disorders. While some studies have reported single-cell open chromatin profiles for the human retina, they often lacked extensive cell-type classification, with epigenomic information remaining largely at the broader cell-class level rather than at the specific cell-type level. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive, high-resolution atlas of the human retina that integrates transcriptomic and epigenomic data at the individual cell-type level to enable a deeper molecular characterization of retinal biology and disease mechanisms. Such an atlas would also be invaluable for understanding the regulatory landscape, as many disease-associated genetic variants map to non-coding, potential regulatory regions.","['Comprehensive Cell Type Classification from Single-Nucleus RNA-seq Data', 'Comparison of snRNA-seq-based Cell Type Classification with a Previous Atlas', 'Analysis of Cell Type Proportions between Central and Peripheral Retina using snRNA-seq', 'Assessment of NeuN-based Enrichment Strategy on Cell Type Proportions in Peripheral Retina snRNA-seq Data', 'Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) for Retinal Cell Types from snRNA-seq Data', 'Cross-species snRNA-seq Data Integration and Cell Type Homology Assessment', 'Characterization of snRNA-seq Expression Profiles for Genes Linked to Putative cis-Regulatory Elements (CREs)', 'Inference and Analysis of Transcription Factor (TF) Activity from snRNA-seq Data', 'Identification and Annotation of Transcription Factor (TF) Co-activity Modules using snRNA-seq-derived TF Activities', 'Supervised Classification using snRNA-seq to Identify Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs) in Additional Datasets']","[{'title': 'Comprehensive Cell Type Classification from Single-Nucleus RNA-seq Data', 'description': 'Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data from over 250,000 nuclei, obtained from six human donors (including peripheral retina samples enriched for rare cells using NeuN antibody sorting), was processed.

science.ade9516.pdf,"The cerebral cortex is integral to complex cognitive functions, including language, which is a hallmark of human distinctiveness. However, the cellular and molecular underpinnings of these human-specific cognitive abilities, particularly those related to cortical specializations, remain largely elusive. While previous research has explored cortical cell type diversity and organization across various mammalian species, a comprehensive understanding of what makes the human cortex unique has been hampered. Comparative transcriptomic studies offer a path to identify conserved and specialized cellular and molecular features across species, but their insights are often constrained by the limited number of species analyzed and their phylogenetic distances. This study addresses these gaps by focusing on the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), a region of the cerebral cortex critically involved in multimodal sensory integration and language comprehension. Anatomically, the human MTG is known to be larger and more extensively connected to other language-associated cortical areas compared to its homolog in nonhuman primates (NHPs). Such anatomical distinctions are hypothesized to correlate with underlying differences in the molecular programs of cortical cells. Earlier comparative studies in primates were often limited by analyzing broad, heterogeneous cell populations or by lacking a sufficient representation of great ape species, which is crucial for discerning human-specific evolutionary trajectories from those shared with our closest relatives. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) technology provides an unprecedented opportunity for unbiased, high-resolution characterization of cellular diversity within complex tissues like the brain. This research leverages deep snRNA-seq profiling of the MTG from five primate species: humans, chimpanzees, gorillas (representing great apes), rhesus macaques (an Old World monkey), and common marmosets (a New World monkey). This selection spans approximately 38 million years of primate evolution, enabling a detailed multi-species comparison. The inclusion of gorillas, alongside chimpanzees, allows for more precise inference of changes unique to the human lineage, distinguishing them from traits shared among African great apes. The two monkey species provide a broader phylogenetic context to identify features that are specific to great apes or are more deeply conserved across primates. The primary scientific goal is to construct a comparative cellular atlas of the primate MTG. This atlas aims to identify homologous cell types across these species and to uncover human-specific molecular and cellular features, which may contribute to the unique cognitive capacities of humans.","['Generation of Within-Species Cell Type Taxonomies', 'Comparative Analysis of Cell Type Abundances Across Species', 'Assessment of Subclass Transcriptomic Conservation and Divergence Across Primates', 'Differential Gene Expression Analysis in Glial Cell Lineages Across Great Apes', 'Construction of a Cross-Species Consensus Primate MTG Cell Type Taxonomy', 'Identification of Species-Specific Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) within Consensus Cell Types', 'Comparative Analysis of Transcript Isoform Usage Across Great Ape Cell Subclasses', 'Integration of Human-Specific DEGs with Genomic Regions of Accelerated Evolution', 'Spatial Characterization of Human MTG Cell Types using snRNA-seq-Informed MERFISH']","[{'title': 'Generation of Within-Species Cell Type Taxonomies', 'description': ""For each of the five primate species (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, rhesus macaque, marmoset), snRNA-seq datasets were independently processed to create a cell type taxonomy.

1-s2.0-S1074761320301321-main.pdf,"T cell development, or thymopoiesis, is a critical process occurring in the thymus, essential for a functional adaptive immune system. This development relies on the continuous migration of hematopoietic progenitor cells from the bone marrow to the thymus. Once in the thymic microenvironment, these multipotent progenitors undergo commitment to the T cell lineage, a process significantly driven by Notch1 signaling, and extensive proliferation to expand the T cell precursor pool. Much of our current understanding of these early events, including the precise nature of the thymus-seeding progenitors (TSPs), comes from studies in mouse models. However, translating these findings to human biology is challenging due to species-specific differences in cell surface markers (e.g., CD25 expression in early T cell development) and potentially distinct molecular regulatory mechanisms. Immature human thymocytes are generally identified by the expression of CD34. Within this CD34+ population, further heterogeneity exists. For instance, CD1a expression is traditionally used to mark T-lineage commitment, but commitment processes are known to initiate even before CD1a upregulation, within the CD34+CD1a- fraction. This CD34+CD1a-CD44+ subset is considered uncommitted and is expected to contain the immigrating TSPs. However, the precise identity and characteristics of these human TSPs have been a subject of debate, with conflicting reports regarding the role of markers like CD7 (e.g., whether CD34+CD7- or CD34+CD7int cells are the true TSPs). Furthermore, it remains unclear to what extent other hematopoietic lineages, such as myeloid or B cell lineages, develop within the human thymus from these early progenitors, as current knowledge largely stems from in vitro studies whose in vivo relevance is not fully established. Understanding the detailed cellular composition and developmental pathways of immature human thymocytes, especially in the postnatal period, is crucial for a complete picture of human T cell development and for potential therapeutic applications.","['Single-Cell Transcriptome and Epitope Profiling of Immature Human Thymocytes', 'Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization of Thymocyte Heterogeneity', 'Cell Type Annotation of Thymocytes by Integration with Bone Marrow Atlas', 'Cell Cycle Analysis of Immature Thymocytes', 'Identification and Transcriptional Characterization of Thymus Seeding Progenitors (TSPs)', 'Trajectory Inference of Early Human T Cell Development', 'Inference of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) in Early T Cell Development', 'Identification of Stage-Specific Cell Surface Markers via GRN Analysis', 'Discovery of a Primed Thymus Seeding Progenitor (TSP2) in Peripheral Blood via scRNA-seq Analysis', 'Comparative Transcriptional and Phenotypic Profiling of TSP1 and TSP2', 'Investigation of Non-T Cell Lineage Development within the Human Thymus', 'Delineation of Myeloid Development Trajectories from Thymic Progenitors', 'Prediction of Lineage Fate Bias for TSP Subsets using STEMNET', 'Comparative Trajectory Analysis of T-lineage Differentiation from TSP1 versus TSP2', 'Cross-Tissue Comparative scRNA-seq Analysis of Progenitor Populations', 'Prediction of Intercellular Signaling Supporting Intrathymic Progenitor Development using NicheNet']","[{'title': 'Single-Cell Transcriptome and Epitope Profiling of Immature Human Thymocytes', 'description': 'Performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on approximately 70,000 CD34+ thymocytes from 5 postnatal human donors.

2025.01.17.633590v1.full.pdf,"Pancreatic islets play a pivotal role in maintaining glucose homeostasis through the coordinated action of their diverse constituent endocrine and affiliate cell types. These cell types include insulin-secreting beta (β) cells, glucagon-secreting alpha (α) cells, somatostatin-secreting delta (δ) cells, pancreatic polypeptide-secreting gamma (γ) cells, and ghrelin-secreting epsilon (ε) cells, which collectively determine the islet's functional output. In human islets, these cells are intermingled, facilitating their response to fluctuating glucose levels. Pancreatic islets are central to the genetics and pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D), primarily through their involvement in insulin secretion defects. There is increasing evidence suggesting that intercellular signaling, such as signals from α- and δ-cells, regulates β-cell function to ensure appropriate insulin secretion. Therefore, a robust understanding of islet cell type-specific gene expression programs and their dysregulation in pathological states like T2D is crucial for defining and understanding pancreatic dysfunction. However, achieving a comprehensive view of these alterations has been challenging. Previous studies have often been limited by factors such as inter-donor variability, modest sample sizes, and/or a relatively small number of cells sampled per individual, which can hinder the ability to detect consistent and reproducible differences associated with T2D.","['Single-cell RNA sequencing library preparation and initial data processing', 'Iterative quality control and doublet removal for single-cell RNA-seq data', 'Integrated analysis for unsupervised clustering and cell type annotation', 'Definition of robust cell type-specific signature genes', 'Functional enrichment analysis of cell type signature genes', 'Identification of sex-specific differentially expressed genes in major endocrine cell types', 'Assessment of islet cell type composition changes across glycemic states', 'Correlation analysis of endocrine cell proportions with HbA1c levels', 'Cell type-specific differential gene expression analysis between glycemic states using pseudobulk profiles', 'Functional pathway enrichment analysis of T2D-associated β-cell DEGs', 'Subclustering analysis to identify putative subpopulations within major endocrine cell types', 'Comparison of endocrine cell subpopulation proportions across glycemic states']","[{'title': 'Single-cell RNA sequencing library preparation and initial data processing', 'description': ""Pancreatic islets from 48 donors (17 ND, 17 T2D, 14 PD) were cultured.

s42003-020-0922-4.pdf,"The skin, as the human body's outermost protective barrier, is composed of two primary layers: the epidermis, predominantly made up of keratinocytes, and the underlying dermis. The dermis is a thicker layer crucial for skin architecture and function, largely consisting of an extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by its numerous fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are essential cells with well-established heterogeneity, exemplified by differences between papillary fibroblasts (in the superficial dermis) and reticular fibroblasts (in the deeper dermis) in terms of morphology, proliferation rates, contractility, response to growth factors, and expression of ECM components like collagens. Functionally, the papillary dermis and its fibroblasts are vital for epidermal organization, partly due to their close interactions with keratinocytes, and are known to be significantly impacted by intrinsic skin aging, which contributes to visible clinical signs such as reduced turgor and increased wrinkling. Beyond their structural roles in ECM production, dermal fibroblasts exhibit functional diversity, actively participating in cutaneous immune responses, wound healing processes, and communication with the nervous and vascular systems within the skin. 

Historically, the characterization of skin cell types, including fibroblast subpopulations, has relied on techniques such as reporter constructs and lineage tracing in mouse models, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using predetermined markers, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). While these methods have provided valuable insights, they are often limited by the need for pre-selected markers or may not fully capture the comprehensive transcriptomic diversity of cell populations. Previous single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies on skin fibroblasts have offered initial glimpses into their heterogeneity but were sometimes constrained by low cell numbers, reliance on mouse models, focus on specific conditions like skin injury, or the analysis of chronically sun-exposed skin. Chronic sun exposure leads to photoaging, which can confound the study of intrinsic, chronological aging. Consequently, a systematic and comprehensive analysis of fibroblast heterogeneity in sun-protected human skin, particularly concerning the transcriptomic changes that occur during intrinsic aging, has been an area requiring further investigation. Understanding these age-related molecular shifts within fibroblast populations holds significant implications for elucidating the mechanisms of human skin aging and its associated phenotypes.","['Comprehensive Cell Atlas Generation and Annotation of Human Sun-Protected Skin', 'Identification and Functional Characterization of Dermal Fibroblast Subpopulations in Young Donors', 'Collagen Gene Expression Profiling Across Young Fibroblast Subpopulations', 'Prediction of Dermal Localization for Young Fibroblast Subpopulations using Gene Signatures', 'Defining Specific Molecular Markers for Distinct Fibroblast Subpopulations', 'Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of Fibroblast Subpopulations Between Young and Old Donors', 'Profiling of Skin Aging-Associated Secreted Protein (SAASP) Gene Expression in Aged Fibroblasts', 'Computational Prediction of Intercellular Communication Networks and Their Age-Related Alterations']","[{'title': 'Comprehensive Cell Atlas Generation and Annotation of Human Sun-Protected Skin', 'description': ""Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on whole-skin samples from five healthy male donors (two young, 25-27 y/o; three old, 53-70 y/o) from a sun-protected inguinoiliac region.

The Journal of Physiology - 2025 - Mimpen - Exploring cellular changes in ruptured human quadriceps tendons at single‐cell.pdf,"Tendon injuries, particularly ruptures, are common clinical problems that often lead to significant pain, disability, and a reduced quality of life, with increasing incidence and socioeconomic costs. These injuries frequently heal poorly, forming granulation (scar) tissue that fails to restore the native mechanical and structural properties of healthy tendon extracellular matrix (ECM), rendering the tendon weaker and susceptible to re-rupture or progression to chronic disease. While tendon ruptures in humans have often been studied during the chronic phase of injury, especially in rotator cuff disease, the early cellular and molecular responses to acute tendon ruptures remain less investigated. A deeper understanding of the cell types contributing to both tendon homeostasis and, critically, the early injury response is crucial for developing strategies to biologically augment tendon repair and improve patient outcomes. Transcriptomic mapping of tendons at single-cell resolution has recently allowed the cellular and molecular landscapes of healthy human hamstring tendons to be deciphered. Healthy human tendon tissue, though having low overall cellular content, contains several cell types including fibroblasts (sometimes termed tenocytes, responsible for ECM production and maintenance), endothelial cells, and various immune cells. Previous research, often in murine models or human chronic tendinopathy, has implicated epitenon or perivascular derived cells as origins for repair fibroblasts, and immune cells like macrophages as key orchestrators. Fibroblast activation has been documented in chronic human tendinopathy. However, the specific fibroblast cell types and states, as well as the comprehensive roles of immune, endothelial, and mural cell compartments, particularly in the early human response to an acute tendon rupture, have not been well characterized. The paucity of knowledge on the cell types acting early in the tendon repair process limits progress in improving patient outcomes. This study focuses on human quadriceps tendons, which are frequently subject to acute rupture requiring surgical repair, thus providing a relevant model to explore the cellular components and molecular characteristics of the fibroproliferative phases of early human tendon injury.","['snRNA-seq Data Preprocessing, Quality Control, Integration, and Initial Cell Type Annotation', 'Differential Abundance Testing of Cell Populations', 'Pseudobulk Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Analysis', 'Sub-clustering and Fine Annotation of Major Cell Lineages', 'Ligand-Receptor Interaction Analysis', 'Inference of Intracellular Pathway and Transcription Factor Activity', 'Single-Cell Regulatory Network Inference and Clustering (SCENIC)']","[{'title': 'snRNA-seq Data Preprocessing, Quality Control, Integration, and Initial Cell Type Annotation', 'description': ""Raw next generation sequencing (NGS) data were quality controlled using fastqc (v0.12.1) and mapped to the human Ensembl GRCh38 transcriptome (release 106) using kallisto bustools kb count (v0.27.3 with kmer size = 31) via the scflow quantnuclei pipeline (python v3.8.15).

jem_20191130.pdf,"The intestine is a vital organ with multifaceted roles including nutrient digestion and absorption, defense against microbes, immune responses, and hormone secretion. While foundational knowledge about major intestinal cell types has been established, particularly through studies on mouse models, a comprehensive understanding of human intestinal cell type-specific markers and their precise functional roles has remained limited. Advances in large-scale single-cell transcriptomic profiling have provided unprecedented opportunities to delineate cellular heterogeneity in various organs. Previous single-cell studies have explored mouse intestinal organoids, different regions of the murine small intestine, and mouse villi, identifying new cell markers, novel cell subtypes (e.g., enteroendocrine cells), differential gene expression patterns, and functional zonation of enterocytes. Single-cell resolution studies have also been conducted on the human fetal digestive tract and adult large intestine, shedding light on transcriptome dynamics during development, and on colon cancer xenografts, revealing transcriptional heterogeneity. However, despite these efforts and extensive transcriptomic analyses in mice, a systematic, high-resolution survey of gene expression profiles across different segments of the adult human intestinal epithelium (ileum, colon, and rectum) at the single-cell level was needed to create detailed cellular landscapes and elucidate functional annotations of different human intestinal segments.","['Comprehensive scRNA-seq Profiling and Cell Type Identification in Human Ileum, Colon, and Rectum', 'Investigation of Regional Differences in Cell Proportions and Cell Cycle Activity in the Human Intestine', 'Segment-Specific Functional Characterization of Intestinal Stem, TA, and Progenitor Cells Using scRNA-seq', 'Mapping Cell-Type and Segment-Specific Transcription Factor Expression Landscapes via scRNA-seq', 'scRNA-seq Profiling of Nutrient Metabolism and Transporter Gene Expression in Human Enterocytes Across Intestinal Segments', 'Segment-Specific Expression Analysis of Signaling Molecules and Hormones from scRNA-seq Data', 'Characterization of Regional Immune Response Gene Signatures in Human Intestinal Epithelium by scRNA-seq', 'scRNA-seq Based Identification and Comparative Transcriptomic Profiling of Paneth-like Cells (PLCs) in the Human Large Intestine', 'scRNA-seq Based Discovery of Potential Novel Markers for Human Transient-Amplifying (TA) and Goblet Cells', 'Cross-Species Comparative scRNA-seq Analysis of Human and Mouse Ileal Epithelial Cells']","[{'title': 'Comprehensive scRNA-seq Profiling and Cell Type Identification in Human Ileum, Colon, and Rectum', 'description': 'Performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 14,537 epithelial cells isolated from human ileum, colon, and rectum.
