Cancer Science - 2023 - Kurkalang - Single‐cell transcriptomic analysis of gingivo‐buccal oral cancer reveals two dominant.pdf,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a significant global health issue, ranking as the 16th most common malignancy worldwide with high mortality. Specifically, OSCC of the gingivo-buccal region (OSCC-GB) is the most prevalent cancer among men in India and sixth among women. OSCC-GB is strongly associated with tobacco chewing habits, often presents at advanced stages (III/IV), and has a high rate of loco-regional failure, contributing to a poor prognosis. Like many cancers, OSCC displays considerable cellular heterogeneity, encompassing diverse cell types with distinct genomic, epigenomic, and phenotypic features within the tumor microenvironment. This heterogeneity is considered a key factor influencing tumor progression, response to treatment, treatment failure/recurrence, and patient survival. While recent single-cell transcriptomic studies have explored heterogeneity in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), particularly focusing on tongue cancer or comparing HPV-positive and HPV-negative cases, the specific intratumor cellular heterogeneity of OSCC-GB remains largely uncharacterized. Previous bulk sequencing studies indicated notable differences in gene expression profiles between tongue cancer and OSCC-GB. Furthermore, some OSCC-GB cases arise in conjunction with a precancerous lesion known as oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), but the cellular features specific to these tumors are not well understood. This study aims to use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the landscape of cellular diversity and identify novel aspects of heterogeneity in cell types and cell states within OSCC-GB tumors, including those with concomitant OSMF.","['Identification of Malignant Epithelial Cells', 'Overall Cell Type Classification and Annotation', 'Analysis of Malignant Cell Heterogeneity and OSMF Association', 'Identification of Cellular Programs in Malignant Cells (pEMT, Fetal/Germ-like)', 'Pseudotime Trajectory Analysis of Malignant Cells', 'Analysis of Immune-Related Gene Expression in Malignant Cells', 'Subclustering and Characterization of T Cells', 'Pseudotime Trajectory Analysis of T Cells', 'Subclustering and Characterization of B Cells', 'Subclustering and Characterization of Myeloid Cells', 'Pseudotime Trajectory Analysis of Macrophages', 'Subclustering and Characterization of Endothelial Cells', 'Subclustering and Characterization of Fibroblasts', 'Pseudotime Trajectory Analysis of Fibroblasts', 'Analysis of Driver Gene Co-expression Patterns', 'Comparison with Bulk RNA-seq Data']","[{'title': 'Identification of Malignant Epithelial Cells', 'description': 'Malignant cells were identified from the epithelial cell population using two methods.

1-s2.0-S2405471224001170-main.pdf,"The placenta serves as a crucial maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, facilitating nutrient exchange while providing protection against infections. However, certain pathogens, including the parasites *Plasmodium falciparum* (causative agent of malaria), *Toxoplasma gondii* (causative agent of toxoplasmosis), and the bacterium *Listeria monocytogenes* (causative agent of listeriosis), can breach or compromise this barrier. Infections by these pathogens during early pregnancy are particularly dangerous, potentially leading to severe complications such as miscarriage, premature labor, low birth weight, stillbirth, and long-term developmental anomalies in the child. The placenta employs innate immune defenses to counter infections. Trophoblasts, the epithelial-like cells forming the outer layers (syncytiotrophoblast - SCT, and underlying villous cytotrophoblast - VCT), constitute a primary physical and immunological barrier. Within the placental stroma, fetal macrophages known as Hofbauer cells (HBCs) represent the main resident immune cell population in a healthy first-trimester placenta. While HBCs are known to have roles in tissue remodeling and angiogenesis, and possess some antimicrobial capabilities, their specific functions during diverse pathogen encounters remain poorly characterized. Studying these interactions directly in humans is challenging. Mouse models have limitations due to significant differences in placental structure and HBC origin compared to humans. Recent advances include human trophoblast stem cells, organoids, and placental explant cultures. Explant cultures, which preserve the complex multi-lineage architecture of the placenta including trophoblasts, stromal cells, endothelial cells, and Hofbauer cells, offer a valuable model. Previous studies using explants often relied on bulk analysis methods, which obscure cell-type-specific responses and interactions. This paper utilizes an optimized human placental explant model from early pregnancy (5-14 post-conceptional weeks) exposed to *P. falciparum*, *T. gondii*, and *L. monocytogenes* to investigate the acute cellular responses at a high resolution.","['Single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq data processing and quality control', 'Cell type annotation of placental cells', 'Integration of single-cell datasets', 'Differential gene expression analysis across conditions and cell types', 'Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis', 'Cell-cell communication inference', 'Analysis of pathogen transcriptomes from scRNA-seq data', 'Benchmarking of explant model against in vivo placental atlas', 'Analysis of cell hashing data']","[{'title': 'Single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq data processing and quality control', 'description': ""Raw sequencing data from 10x Genomics single-cell (scRNA-seq) and single-nuclei (snRNA-seq) experiments were aligned and quantified.

10.1371_journal.pbio.3000152.pdf,"Mammalian kidney development is a complex process involving crosstalk between the metanephric mesenchyme (MM) and the ureteric bud (UB). The UB invades the MM and undergoes branching morphogenesis, while the cap mesenchyme (CM) surrounding the UB tips contains nephron progenitor cells (NPCs). NPCs self-renew and differentiate, undergoing mesenchymal-epithelial transition through intermediate structures (pretubular aggregate [PTA], renal vesicle [RV], comma-shaped body [CSB], and s-shaped body [SSB]) to form the nephron epithelium. The collecting duct system originates from the UB. Stromal cells (interstitial cells, mesangial cells, etc.) arise from interstitial progenitors, while endothelial cells form the vasculature, and leukocytes enter via blood. Current understanding relies heavily on mouse models, but significant morphological and gene expression differences exist between mouse and human renal embryogenesis. This divergence, coupled with a scarcity of detailed gene expression data for human kidney development, hinders a thorough understanding of human nephrogenesis and the potential developmental origins of kidney diseases. Regenerative medicine approaches for kidney disease require detailed knowledge of human kidney development, which is currently lacking compared to mouse models. This study aims to address this gap by characterizing gene expression dynamics during human fetal kidney development.","['Single-cell transcriptomic profiling and cell type identification in human fetal kidney (w16)', 'Cell cycle phase analysis', 'Proliferation marker analysis', 'Pseudotime trajectory inference for nephron development', 'Comparison with external human fetal kidney scRNA-seq data', 'Identification of novel cell type marker genes', 'Comparative analysis across multiple developmental timepoints', 'Differential gene expression analysis of podocytes across development', 'Investigation of heterogeneity within the nephrogenic niche', 'Characterization of podocyte precursor development', 'Integration with GWAS data for disease relevance']","[{'title': 'Single-cell transcriptomic profiling and cell type identification in human fetal kidney (w16)', 'description': ""Performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using 10x Genomics Chromium platform on a dissociated human fetal kidney at week 16 (w16) gestation.

1-s2.0-S2666379123003117-main.pdf,"Autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a highly effective treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (rrLBCL), significantly improving patient outcomes. However, this therapy is associated with various toxicities that can delay patient recovery. While the biological mechanisms of early-onset toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune-effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) have been investigated, the pathophysiology of longer-term toxicities like prolonged cytopenia (PC) is poorly understood. PC is defined as grade ≥3 cytopenia (encompassing anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia) that persists beyond 30 days after CAR T-cell infusion. It affects approximately 30% of patients, and its occurrence and duration often exceed what would be expected from the lymphodepleting chemotherapy (e.g., fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) used as conditioning, suggesting mechanisms beyond conditioning-induced myelosuppression. PC can persist for several months to years, leading to significant clinical challenges, including the need for frequent blood transfusions, hospitalizations due to infections, and limitations in administering subsequent anti-cancer treatments if the lymphoma progresses. Therefore, identifying the underlying mechanisms of PC and developing targeted therapeutic strategies is a critical unmet need for improving the long-term outcomes of CAR T-cell therapy recipients. It is known from broader hematology research that cytokines like interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) can play a role in regulating hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) functions, including self-renewal and differentiation, and dysregulation of such pathways can lead to bone marrow dysfunction.","['Construction of a single-cell atlas of bone marrow and comparison between rrLBCL patients and healthy donors', 'Identification of differentially abundant bone marrow cell populations in CAR T patients with prolonged cytopenia (PC)', 'Single-cell pathway analysis comparing bone marrow cells from CAR T patients with and without prolonged cytopenia (PC)', 'Characterization of IFN-γ response signatures in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from CAR T patients with prolonged cytopenia (PC)', 'Quantification and source identification of IFNG expression in the bone marrow of CAR T patients with prolonged cytopenia (PC)', 'In-depth sub-clustering and characterization of bone marrow CD8 T cells', 'Identification of differentially abundant CD8 T cell subsets in CAR T patients with prolonged cytopenia (PC)', 'Analysis of T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion within CD8 T cell subsets from CAR T patients with prolonged cytopenia (PC)', 'Search for public TCR motifs in expanded CD8 T cell clonotypes from patients with prolonged cytopenia (PC)', 'Screening for T-LGL-associated STAT3 mutations in bone marrow CD8 T cells', 'Comparative expression analysis of IFNG and TBX21 in CD8 T cell subsets from CAR T patients with and without prolonged cytopenia (PC)', 'Assessment of CAR construct expression in bone marrow CD8 T cells post-infusion', 'Re-analysis of CAR T cell infusion products to identify pre-infusion correlates of prolonged cytopenia (PC)']","[{'title': 'Construction of a single-cell atlas of bone marrow and comparison between rrLBCL patients and healthy donors', 'description': ""Bone marrow mononuclear cells (92,676 cells post-QC) from 22 individuals, including 16 rrLBCL patients post-CAR T therapy (11 with prolonged cytopenia (PC), 5 without PC, though 2 PC samples were later excluded from comparative analyses due to AML/LBCL involvement, resulting in 9 PC and 5 no PC for those comparisons), 5 healthy donors, and 1 rrLBCL patient with chemotherapy-associated cytopenia (control), were processed using 10x Genomics 5'GEX with paired T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing.

1-s2.0-S1074761323000122-mainext.pdf,"Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic gastrointestinal disease with increasing global prevalence, representing a significant healthcare burden. It is understood to be a multifactorial condition, arising from a complex interplay of genetic predispositions, immune system dysregulation, and environmental factors. CD, along with ulcerative colitis (UC), falls under the umbrella of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which are characterized by immune-mediated, relapsing-remitting chronic inflammation of the gut. While both CD and UC involve a dysfunctional and hyperactive immune response, they differ in their presentation: CD inflammation can affect all layers of the gut and may occur discontinuously throughout the intestinal tract, whereas UC inflammation is typically limited to the colonic epithelium. CD predominantly affects the terminal ileum (TI) and colon (CO), and emerging evidence suggests that ileal-dominant and colonic CD might represent distinct disease subtypes, underscoring the importance of understanding site-specific cellular and molecular mechanisms. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and exome sequencing have identified numerous risk genes for IBD, implicating pathways related to epithelial barrier function, microbial sensing, and adaptive immunity. The intestinal environment itself is a complex ecosystem involving intricate interactions between diverse host cell types—including epithelial, stromal, and immune cells—and environmental elements like dietary components and the microbiota. Understanding the cellular networks that govern intestinal homeostasis and IBD pathogenesis necessitates high-resolution, system-level approaches. Previous research using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in IBD has begun to illustrate disease-associated changes in cell subsets and gene expression, for instance, in UC and in specific aspects of CD such as T-cell distributions in the TI or pediatric CD. However, a comprehensive, cross-organ comparison of the cellular and transcriptional landscape in both the ileum and colon in adult CD, particularly considering inflamed and non-inflamed tissues from the same individuals, is crucial for a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms and for identifying potential therapeutic targets.","['Single-cell Atlas Generation and Comprehensive Cell Type Annotation', 'Cell-Type Compositional Analysis Across Disease States and Anatomical Locations', 'Expression Profiling and Contextualization of IBD Risk Genes', 'Cell-Type Specific Differential Gene Expression (DGE) Analysis in Response to Inflammation', 'Characterization of Enteroendocrine Cell (EEC) Heterogeneity and Transcriptional Dysregulation in CD', 'Analysis of Myofibroblast States, Transitions, and Regulatory Networks in CD']","[{'title': 'Single-cell Atlas Generation and Comprehensive Cell Type Annotation', 'description': ""Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on 720,633 cells obtained from terminal ileum (TI) and colon (CO) biopsies of 46 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 25 non-IBD controls.

s41467-019-12464-3.pdf,"Human T lymphocytes are crucial components of the adaptive immune system, responsible for coordinating immune responses, establishing protective immunity, and maintaining homeostasis. They operate in diverse anatomical compartments, including blood, lymphoid tissues (like lymph nodes and bone marrow), and mucosal or barrier tissues (like lungs). T cell activation, typically initiated via the T cell receptor (TCR), triggers transcriptional programs leading to differentiation into effector cells with specific functions: CD4+ T cells primarily secrete cytokines to modulate other immune cells, while CD8+ T cells acquire cytotoxic capabilities to eliminate infected or cancerous cells. Following an immune response, some T cells develop into long-lived memory cells. These include circulating central memory (TCM) and effector memory (TEM) subsets, as well as non-circulating tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) which persist locally within tissues. Studies, particularly in mouse models, highlight the importance of TRM cells in providing rapid, localized protection against pathogens. However, much of the understanding of human T cell function comes from studying peripheral blood. It's known that the majority of human T cells reside in tissues, not blood, and that T cell subset composition varies significantly depending on the tissue site. Human TRM cells share some core transcriptional and protein signatures with their mouse counterparts, distinguishing them from circulating T cells. Despite this, fundamental questions remain regarding how the tissue microenvironment influences human T cell persistence, functional responses upon activation, and the precise relationship between T cells in blood versus various tissues. Furthermore, while functional subsets (like Th1, Th2, Th17 for CD4+ T cells) and states (like exhaustion, marked by inhibitory receptors) have been characterized, often based on mouse studies or cytokine profiles, a comprehensive map of the diverse functional states of human T cells, particularly within different healthy tissues, is lacking. Establishing such a baseline understanding of healthy human T cell states across multiple anatomical locations is essential for interpreting T cell behavior in disease contexts, such as infections, autoimmunity, and cancer.","['Initial Characterization and Clustering of Tissue T cells', 'Comparison of Blood and Tissue T Cell Transcriptomes', 'Identification of a Core Tissue Gene Signature', 'Identification of Conserved T Cell Activation States using Factor Analysis', 'Visualization of T Cell Activation Trajectories', 'Mapping Tumor-Associated T Cells onto the Healthy Reference Atlas']","[{'title': 'Initial Characterization and Clustering of Tissue T cells', 'description': 'Single cell RNA-seq data from resting and anti-CD3/CD28-activated CD3+ T cells isolated from lung (LG), lymph node (LN), and bone marrow (BM) of two deceased organ donors were analyzed.

fdmed-02-806294.pdf,"Dental caries, initiated by acid-producing oral bacteria, leads to a progressive demineralization of enamel and dentin. As carious lesions advance towards the dentin-pulp interface, microbial components diffusing through dentinal tubules can trigger protective responses from stromal and immune cells within the dental pulp. This includes the formation of tertiary dentin by odontoblasts to wall off the infection. If the infectious tooth structure is removed and restored, tissue homeostasis can be regained. However, more severe stimuli, such as persistent deep carious lesions, can result in odontoblast death and the recruitment of pulp stem cells, which differentiate into odontoblast-like cells to secrete reparative dentin. When inflammation overwhelms healing mechanisms, this can lead to irreversible pulpitis and potentially pulp necrosis.
Traditional endodontic treatment, while an alternative to extraction, results in loss of tooth vitality. Regenerative dentistry approaches, including vital pulp therapy, particularly for immature permanent teeth, aim to reduce pulpal inflammation and preserve vitality using biomaterials and stem cell therapies. However, the indications for these regenerative procedures are currently limited. A delicate balance between inflammation and regeneration is essential for defending against cariogenic bacteria and subsequent inflammation resolution. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the functions of stromal and immune cells in dental pulp under both normal physiological and pathological (carious) conditions is crucial for advancing regenerative dentistry.
Previous studies have employed methods like multicolor flow cytometry to characterize heterogeneous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in human dental pulp, though immune cell populations have been less extensively studied. Flow cytometry data suggests immune cells (neutrophils, T cells, macrophages, NK cells) constitute only about 1% of the total pulpal population, with B cells reportedly infiltrating inflamed pulp but not healthy pulp. A key limitation of flow cytometry is its reliance on a predefined set of cell surface markers, which may not capture the full cellular heterogeneity, including rare cell types or distinct functional subgroups.
Bulk transcriptomic studies have also been used to investigate global gene expression changes between healthy and inflamed pulpal tissues. These studies have revealed that genes in immune and inflammatory response pathways are upregulated in dental caries, while those in biosynthesis pathways are downregulated. However, bulk transcriptomics provide average gene expression levels across all cell types present in the tissue. This approach is often dominated by highly abundant cell types, potentially masking crucial information from minor but functionally significant cell types, such as various immune cell subsets.
While single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for detailed cellular characterization at the individual cell level, previous scRNA-seq studies on dental pulp have primarily focused on delineating cellular heterogeneity during human tooth development or on in-depth characterization of MSCs in healthy dental pulp tissues. There is a need to comprehensively explore the diverse cell populations and their specific transcriptomic profiles within the dental pulp in the context of both health (sound teeth) and varying stages of dental caries (e.g., enamel caries, deep dental caries) to better understand the molecular underpinnings of pulpal disease and inform future regenerative strategies.","['Single-Cell Transcriptome Generation and Quality Control from Human Dental Pulp', 'Integration, Clustering, and Visualization of Dental Pulp Single-Cell Transcriptomes', 'Cell Type Annotation and Compositional Analysis in Dental Pulp', 'Differential Gene Expression Analysis Across Caries Stages and Cell Types', 'Computational Prediction of Cell-Cell Interactions in Dental Pulp']","[{'title': 'Single-Cell Transcriptome Generation and Quality Control from Human Dental Pulp', 'description': ""Single-cell suspensions were prepared from human dental pulp tissues collected from sound molars, molars with enamel caries, and molars with deep dental caries.

dev199711.pdf,"The spinal cord is a crucial component of the central nervous system, responsible for processing sensory inputs from the peripheral nervous system and controlling motor output by regulating motor neurons. These functions are executed by complex neural circuits, which are composed of numerous molecularly and physiologically distinct neuronal subtypes. During embryonic development, these diverse neuronal populations are generated in a highly organized spatiotemporal manner from proliferating progenitor cells residing within the embryonic neural tube and the neural crest. The precise arrangement of these progenitors and the identities of the neurons they produce are orchestrated by intricate gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which are themselves under the control of extrinsic signaling molecules. The composition and operation of these GRNs have been extensively investigated in model organisms such as mouse, chick, and zebrafish. In recent years, systematic profiling of single cells from the mouse neural tube and neural crest using techniques like scRNA-seq has provided comprehensive gene expression atlases, revealed underlying cellular complexity, and enabled detailed molecular classification of multiple cell types in these models. However, while much attention has been given to profiling the developing human brain, the embryonic human spinal cord and peripheral nervous system (PNS) have been comparatively less well-described. Available molecular characterizations suggest that the overall organization of progenitors and neurons is largely similar between humans and other vertebrates. Nevertheless, the precise extent of similarity in the molecular composition of cells in mouse and human neural tubes has not been fully determined, and several features of human neural tube development, such as the co-expression of transcription factors OLIG2 and NKX2-2 in a subset of neural progenitors, have been reported to differ from other species. A systematic and comprehensive profiling of cell identity in the developing human nervous system is thus essential to provide a clearer picture of human neural tube development and to enable detailed comparisons with other species. Such efforts would generate a valuable catalogue of gene expression and cell type identity in the human neural tube, supporting future studies of sensory and motor control systems.","['Generation and initial characterization of a human developing spinal cord scRNA-seq atlas', 'Integrated analysis of neural cell populations across developmental time', 'Supervised classification of central nervous system (CNS) progenitor and neuronal subtypes', 'Transcriptional similarity comparison between human and mouse CNS cell types', 'Comparative analysis of in vivo human spinal cord development with in vitro motor neuron differentiation', 'Identification of species-specific gene expression patterns in human spinal cord cell types', 'Expression profiling of primate-specific genes in the developing human spinal cord', 'Classification and developmental trajectory analysis of peripheral nervous system (PNS) cell types', 'Analysis of neurogenesis and gliogenesis dynamics in the human CNS', 'Investigation of temporal transcription factor code conservation in human neuronal development', 'Reconstruction of neurogenic lineage trajectories using RNA velocity', 'Molecular characterization of OLIG2 and NKX2-2 co-expressing neural progenitors']","[{'title': 'Generation and initial characterization of a human developing spinal cord scRNA-seq atlas', 'description': 'Cervical-thoracic regions were microdissected from four human embryos at Carnegie stages (CS) CS12, CS14, CS17, and CS19 (gestational weeks 4-7).

cells-13-01991-v2.pdf,"The airway epithelium serves as a crucial protective barrier within the respiratory system. It is primarily composed of three main cell types: ciliated cells, secretory cells, and basal cells. Ciliated cells are vital for mucociliary clearance, a process where they expel pathogens and foreign particles that have been trapped in mucus, which is produced by secretory cells. Basal cells act as the primary airway stem cells; they possess the ability to differentiate into both secretory and ciliated cells, thereby maintaining tissue homeostasis and facilitating repair following injury. This differentiation into ciliated cells can occur either through the direct differentiation of basal cells or via the transdifferentiation of existing secretory cells.

To investigate human lung development and create models for various respiratory diseases, human airway epithelial cells are frequently cultured in vitro. These cells are typically obtained from lung tissue biopsies and can be grown in two main formats: as three-dimensional (3D) airway organoids or within air-liquid interface (ALI) culture systems. Airway 3D organoids, often derived from basal or club cells, can be maintained for extended periods and can generate various differentiated cell types. However, a common limitation is their frequent failure to produce a significant population of ciliated cells. In contrast, ALI culture systems, where epithelial cells are cultured on a permeable membrane with the apical (top) side exposed to air and the basal (bottom) side in contact with culture medium, are designed to mimic the in vivo airway environment. This setup encourages basal cells to undergo proper differentiation, forming a pseudostratified epithelium that includes both ciliated and secretory cells, thus providing a more robust in vitro model of the human airway.

Despite the advantages of ALI culture, the methodology has not been universally standardized, which can impact its reliability and reproducibility across different studies. A persistent challenge is that even ALI systems may not consistently yield a sufficient quantity of ciliated cells to accurately reflect their proportions in the native human respiratory epithelium. Given that ciliated cells play an indispensable role in airway function and are critical for modeling respiratory diseases (including their role as primary targets for viral infections like SARS-CoV-2), the ability to generate in vitro models containing an adequate number of these specialized cells is of high importance. Consequently, identifying the specific molecular factors and key regulatory signaling pathways that govern the differentiation of ciliated cells is crucial for developing improved and more physiologically relevant in vitro airway epithelial models. This paper aims to explore the transcriptomic landscape of human lung organoids cultured under ALI conditions compared to submerged cultures to uncover these regulatory mechanisms influencing epithelial differentiation.","['Single-cell RNA-seq Data Preprocessing and Integration', 'Cell Type and Subtype Identification and Annotation', 'Comparative Cell Composition Analysis', 'RNA Velocity and Pseudotime Trajectory Analysis', 'Evaluation of Transcriptomic Similarity to In Vivo Lung Tissue', 'Differential Gene Expression Analysis Between Culture Conditions', 'Functional Interpretation, Network Analysis, and Upstream Regulator Identification from DEGs']","[{'title': 'Single-cell RNA-seq Data Preprocessing and Integration', 'description': ""Raw sequencing reads from eight samples were processed using Cell Ranger (v7.0.1) to generate gene-cell count matrices by aligning reads to the GRCh38 human reference genome.

Second, Seurat's label-transfer algorithm was employed to determine similarity scores by comparing the single-cell transcriptomic profiles from the culture models to reference datasets derived from the Integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA), specifically focusing on normal lung parenchymal airway epithelium.

These GRNs were built incorporating known interactions from the BioGRID and STRING databases. The significance of individual genes within these networks was assessed by calculating centrality and closeness scores.

1-s2.0-S1569199325000499-main.pdf,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting, multisystem, autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The CFTR protein is crucial for regulating the pH and hydration of the epithelial lining fluid via chloride and bicarbonate transport. In the lungs of people with CF (pwCF), CFTR dysfunction leads to dehydrated and thickened epithelial lining fluid, acidification, and hypoxia. These changes result in impaired mucociliary clearance, with mucus tethering, loss of ciliary function, and reduced antimicrobial activity, creating a hyper-inflammatory state and predisposing to persistent bacterial infections, such as by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

While CFTR modulator therapies (e.g., Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor) have significantly improved clinical outcomes for many pwCF, including lung function and exacerbation frequency, they are not universally applicable due to side effects or drug-drug interactions. Furthermore, despite modulator therapy reducing systemic and local inflammatory markers, bacterial infections and airway inflammation often persist as substantial problems. Consequently, there remains a critical need for alternative treatment strategies for pwCF.

Effective anti-microbial immunity and the maintenance of lung homeostasis depend on continuous communication between structural cells (like epithelial cells) and immune cells. Disruptions in this epithelial-immune cell crosstalk are known to contribute to airway inflammation and irreversible tissue remodeling in other chronic respiratory diseases, such as COPD and asthma. The airways of pwCF also undergo extensive remodeling, and their immune system has an impaired capacity to clear infections.

Previous single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies in CF have provided insights into specific compartments. For instance, analyses of airway epithelial cells from pwCF showed increased secretory activity, reduced basal (stem) cell proliferation, and skewed differentiation towards ciliated cells, indicative of dysfunctional tissue repair. Studies on sputum samples from pwCF identified an influx of recruited monocytes and immature pro-inflammatory neutrophils, contrasting with the alveolar macrophage dominance in healthy controls. Investigations of lung tissue from pwCF revealed increased numbers of lymphoid follicles and activated B cells. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from children with CF showed distinct macrophage populations and CD4+ T cells expressing inflammatory signaling genes, though statistical comparisons with healthy controls were often limited. Additionally, research has pointed to failures in adaptive immunity, such as ineffective T cell responses against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and altered T cell cytokine profiles in CF.

Despite these advances, these studies have largely focused on isolated cell types or compartments. A comprehensive transcriptional characterization of the full spectrum of both innate and adaptive immune cells in conjunction with structural cells from the same CF lung tissue microenvironment has been lacking. This gap in knowledge obscures a complete understanding of airway lymphocyte phenotypes and the nature of (dysregulated) structural-immune cell crosstalk in pwCF, and how these are altered in the disease state, which is critical for developing new therapeutic approaches to restore airway homeostasis.","['Generation and Integration of a Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas from Bronchial Biopsies', 'Cell Type Annotation and Atlas Creation', 'Comparative Analysis of Cellular Composition in CF and Healthy Airways', 'Differential Gene Expression Analysis in Epithelial Cell Subsets', 'Differential Gene Expression Analysis in Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Prediction of Altered Intercellular Crosstalk using Ligand-Receptor Analysis']","[{'title': 'Generation and Integration of a Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas from Bronchial Biopsies', 'description': ""Droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (10X Chromium) was performed on bronchial biopsies obtained from three patients with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), yielding a total of 19,855 cells.
