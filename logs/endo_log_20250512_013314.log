PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi-tools, scVelo, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/endo_data.h5ad
    10. If trying to use scVelo, insert the following code snippet BEFORE the "import scvelo" statement:
    import matplotlib
    class mplDeprecation(UserWarning):
        pass
    matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation = mplDeprecation
    11. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    12. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps. 

You are given the following summary of the anndata object:

Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
This study focuses on the human endometrium—a dynamic tissue that undergoes cyclical remodeling, shedding, and regeneration during the menstrual cycle. These dramatic transformations are central to reproductive physiology, as they underlie fertility and the establishment of a receptive state for embryo implantation known as the window of implantation (WOI). The biological background of the study is rooted in understanding how different cell types within the endometrium change their gene expression profiles over the cycle, how these changes regulate tissue homeostasis, and how failures or deviations in these processes might be linked to fertility issues and endometrial diseases.

Biological background  
Relevant biological questions include deciphering the molecular signatures that define each phase of the menstrual cycle, particularly the abrupt transcriptional activation that marks the opening of the WOI. The investigation also centers on the mechanisms behind cellular differentiation, decidualization of stromal fibroblasts, and the interplay among various cell types—including ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells, stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells, and smooth muscle cells. This enhanced resolution of cellular heterogeneity paves the way for better understanding of normal reproductive physiology and provides a baseline reference for studying endometrial pathologies.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors began their investigation by applying dimensional reduction techniques (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, or t-SNE, and uniform manifold approximation, UMAP) on single-cell RNA sequencing data generated using the Fluidigm C1 platform and validated with the 10x Chromium system. They analyzed 2,148 cells from 19 healthy donors, identifying clear segregation into distinct groups. Differential expression analysis and density-based clustering revealed six major cell types—stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, unciliated epithelium, and a previously uncharacterized ciliated epithelium. In the 10x dataset of over 71,000 cells, an additional smooth muscle cell type was uncovered. The identification and characterization of these cell types, using canonical markers and newly discovered discriminatory genes (e.g., those marking ciliated epithelium), provide a comprehensive cellular atlas of the endometrium.

Paper’s computational analyses  
Next, the study employed a mutual information (MI)–based approach to build a pseudotime trajectory that connected cellular transcriptomic states across the menstrual cycle within the major endometrial cell types. By selecting “time-associated” genes, the researchers generated principal curves in t-SNE space to order cells along a continuous trajectory. This analysis revealed four distinct phases for both unciliated epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts. A striking finding was that unciliated epithelia displayed an abrupt, discontinuous transition in gene expression—marked by a rapid activation of a specific gene module that includes PAEP, GPX3, and CXCL14—corresponding to the opening of the WOI. In contrast, stromal fibroblasts showed a more gradual transition with modular upregulation of decidualization markers, underscoring different dynamics in epithelial versus stromal compartment transitions.

Paper’s computational analyses  
Further detailed analyses focused on unraveling finer cellular heterogeneity and regulatory mechanisms. The unciliated epithelium was deconvoluted into glandular and luminal subtypes based on differential expression of genes such as WNT7A, LGR5, and FOXA2; these markers correspond to previously documented differences in anatomical function and remodeling during the cycle. Additionally, the study characterized global transcription factor dynamics and secreted protein profiles by clustering dynamically expressed genes in both cell types. The team applied gene ontology enrichment to relate these expression patterns to processes like differentiation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and morphogenesis. Parallel cell cycle analyses using canonical G1/S and G2/M gene sets helped identify proliferative versus secretory phases, confirming that the transition from a high-cycling state to a quiescent, receptive state occurs between phases in both epithelia and stromal fibroblasts, thereby linking transcriptomic signatures with histological observations.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises multi-platform single-cell transcriptomic profiles derived from human endometrial biopsies collected from healthy ovum donors during a natural menstrual cycle. Specifically, 19 donors contributed samples to the Fluidigm C1 dataset (2,148 cells), while an independent validation set of ten donors was profiled using the 10x Chromium system (over 71,000 cells). Alongside cell-type–specific gene expression counts, the dataset includes metadata such as day of menstrual cycle, phase assignments based on both transcriptomic and histological criteria, and spatial data from RNAscope and immunofluorescence imaging. This rich combinatorial dataset connects molecular signatures to key reproductive events like the WOI and decidualization, serving as an essential resource for understanding normal endometrial physiology and providing a baseline for future studies on endometrial diseases and fertility treatments.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the transcriptional heterogeneity (dispersion) within specific endometrial cell types changes systematically over the menstrual cycle, reflecting cellular state transitions that may be critical for the window of implantation. In particular, key cell types such as Unciliated epithelia and Stromal fibroblasts are expected to show significant temporal shifts in their gene expression dispersion.

Analysis Plan:
1. Perform an exploratory analysis to identify highly variable genes (HVGs) across the entire dataset to capture the main sources of biological variability.
2. For a selected set of cell types (e.g., Unciliated epithelia, Stromal fibroblasts, and Endothelia), group cells by the day of sampling and compute a measure of transcriptional dispersion (e.g., the coefficient of variation or average dispersion computed over HVGs) within each group.
3. Visualize the temporal trends of dispersion for each cell type using line plots arranged in a grid; this will reveal how heterogeneity evolves over the menstrual cycle.
4. Perform statistical testing (e.g., Spearman correlation or linear regression) to assess whether changes in dispersion over day are significant for each cell type.
5. Interpret the trends to understand if an increase or decrease in transcriptional heterogeneity correlates with important reproductive states, such as the window of implantation, and generate summary figures and statistical reports.

Initial Code:
import scanpy as sc

# Step 1: Identify highly variable genes (HVGs) in the dataset using the Seurat method
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata, flavor='seurat', n_top_genes=2000)

# Optionally, visualize the HVG metrics to check their distribution
sc.pl.highly_variable_genes(adata, show=True)

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the transcriptional heterogeneity (dispersion) within specific endometrial cell types changes systematically over the menstrual cycle, reflecting cellular state transitions that may be critical for the window of implantation. In particular, key cell types such as Unciliated epithelia and Stromal fibroblasts are expected to show significant temporal shifts in their gene expression dispersion.

Analysis Plan:
['Perform an exploratory analysis to identify highly variable genes (HVGs) across the entire dataset to capture the main sources of biological variability.', 'For a selected set of cell types (e.g., Unciliated epithelia, Stromal fibroblasts, and Endothelia), group cells by the day of sampling and compute a measure of transcriptional dispersion (e.g., the coefficient of variation or average dispersion computed over HVGs) within each group.', 'Visualize the temporal trends of dispersion for each cell type using line plots arranged in a grid; this will reveal how heterogeneity evolves over the menstrual cycle.', 'Perform statistical testing (e.g., Spearman correlation or linear regression) to assess whether changes in dispersion over day are significant for each cell type.', 'Interpret the trends to understand if an increase or decrease in transcriptional heterogeneity correlates with important reproductive states, such as the window of implantation, and generate summary figures and statistical reports.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc

# Step 1: Identify highly variable genes (HVGs) in the dataset using the Seurat method
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata, flavor='seurat', n_top_genes=2000)

# Optionally, visualize the HVG metrics to check their distribution
sc.pl.highly_variable_genes(adata, show=True)

Feedback:
Feedback on the Code:
• The code snippet correctly uses Scanpy’s highly variable genes function with the Seurat method and is concise.  
• Including the visualization step (sc.pl.highly_variable_genes) is useful for quality control.  
• Ensure that “adata” is already in memory as indicated and that any downstream analyses retain the HVG information (e.g., by storing or referencing adata.var['highly_variable']).  
• Consider adding comments about potential downstream normalization or filtering steps if needed for consistency across cells and datasets.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is well aligned with the hypothesis by focusing on transcriptional dispersion over the menstrual cycle.  
• It is distinct from the paper’s pseudotime and differential expression approaches and takes a novel perspective by using dispersion metrics.  
• The stepwise approach—HVG identification, grouping by day for select cell types, quantifying dispersion, visualizing trends, and performing statistical tests—is logical and can uncover dynamic transcriptional heterogeneity.  
• Emphasize the need to account for differences between platforms (10x vs. C1) and ensure that the HVG selection is robust across these conditions, potentially by checking metadata consistency.  
• Future steps should clearly state the cell-type–specific analyses and grid visualization to compare temporal dispersion trends directly.  
• Overall, the plan’s focus on key cell types (Unciliated epithelia and Stromal fibroblasts) and the systematic assessment over cycle days is novel relative to previous analyses.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the transcriptional heterogeneity (dispersion) within specific endometrial cell types, such as Unciliated epithelia and Stromal fibroblasts, changes systematically over the menstrual cycle. These temporal shifts in gene expression dispersion may indicate critical cellular state transitions associated with the window of implantation.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Perform an exploratory analysis to identify highly variable genes (HVGs) across the entire dataset, ensuring that HVG selection is robust across different platforms (10x vs C1) by checking for metadata consistency.
2. Store the HVG information (e.g., adata.var['highly_variable']) for downstream analyses and note potential normalization or filtering steps to adjust for platform differences and ensure consistency.
3. For selected cell types (Unciliated epithelia, Stromal fibroblasts, and Endothelia), group cells by day of sampling and compute a measure of transcriptional dispersion (for example, the coefficient of variation or average dispersion computed over HVGs) for each group.
4. Visualize the temporal trends of dispersion for each cell type using line plots arranged in a grid, allowing direct comparison of trends and accounting for platform-specific effects.
5. Perform statistical testing (e.g., Spearman correlation or linear regression) to assess the significance of dispersion changes over the menstrual cycle, and print the test results for interpretation.
6. Interpret the outcomes to determine if changes in transcriptional heterogeneity correlate with key reproductive states such as the window of implantation.

Revised Code:
import scanpy as sc

# Step 1: Identify highly variable genes (HVGs) using the Seurat method.
# This step computes the top 2000 HVGs and stores the information in adata.var['highly_variable'] for downstream analyses.
# Ensure that 'adata' is available in memory and includes metadata to later check for platform (10x vs C1) consistency.
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata, flavor='seurat', n_top_genes=2000)

# Optionally, visualize the distribution of HVG metrics to assess quality control across cells and platforms.
sc.pl.highly_variable_genes(adata, show=True)

# Note: Future steps may incorporate normalization or additional filtering to refine data consistency across different cell types and datasets.
