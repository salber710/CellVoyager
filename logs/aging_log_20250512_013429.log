PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi-tools, scVelo, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/final_aging_brain_eric.h5ad
    10. If trying to use scVelo, insert the following code snippet BEFORE the "import scvelo" statement:
    import matplotlib
    class mplDeprecation(UserWarning):
        pass
    matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation = mplDeprecation
    11. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    12. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps. 

You are given the following summary of the anndata object:

Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
This paper investigates aging in the brain with a special focus on the subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenic niche—a region essential for neural stem cell (NSC)–mediated neurogenesis that supports functions like olfactory discrimination and repair. The study addresses the dual challenge of quantifying both chronological and biological aging at a cellular resolution. Aging in the neurogenic region is linked to cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders, and the authors seek to understand how distinct cell types age at different rates. They further explore whether interventions thought to rejuvenate tissues, such as heterochronic parabiosis and exercise, actually reverse transcriptomic signatures of aging.

Biological background  
Because aging is the primary risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, unraveling its molecular basis is of critical importance. Questions central to this work include: Which cell types within the SVZ age at different speeds? What are the specific gene expression changes that account for aging and how are these counteracted by rejuvenation strategies? The study also examines how functional metrics—like the declining proliferative capacity of NSCs—complement chronological age, thereby offering a deeper insight into the underlying mechanisms of brain aging and providing a platform to test potential interventions.

Paper's computational analyses  
The authors began by generating single-cell RNA sequencing profiles from the subventricular zone of 28 mice spanning a wide age range (from 3 to 29 months). Using lipid-modified oligonucleotide (LMO) multiplexing, they aggregated 21,458 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes that were visualized via UMAP clustering. This analysis confirmed the presence of 11 distinct cell types, including several from the NSC lineage and differentiated cells like microglia and oligodendrocytes. In addition, cell cycle scoring demonstrated an age-associated decline in proliferative NSCs. These analyses not only established the cellular heterogeneity of the aging niche but also provided the basis for building quantitative aging clocks.

Paper's computational analyses  
Taking advantage of the single-cell dataset, the study built cell-type-specific “aging clocks” using supervised machine learning. The authors constructed regression models (using lasso and elastic net methods) on carefully designed “BootstrapCells” and “EnsembleCells” (each being small pools of 15 single-cell profiles) to predict both chronological age and a functional metric of biological age defined by NSC proliferative fraction. Cross-cohort validations revealed that the models achieved high correlations (Pearson R ranging from 0.71 to 0.92) with low prediction errors, underscoring that different cell types display distinct aging trajectories. They also developed biological aging clocks that, although exhibiting slightly lower performance, demonstrated a strong positive correlation with chronological age, reinforcing that functional decline in neurogenesis is tightly coupled with cellular age.

Paper's computational analyses  
The robustness and generalizability of these aging clocks were further tested using several external single-cell RNA-seq datasets. The models successfully predicted age in independent SVZ datasets, in a different neurogenic region (the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus), and even in human brain samples. In parallel, the investigators dissected the gene contributions underlying the clocks by visualizing clock components with donut plots, assessing shared versus cell-type-specific genes via UpSet plots, and performing pathway enrichment analyses. In a subsequent set of analyses, the authors applied their clocks to single-cell datasets generated from mice undergoing heterochronic parabiosis and exercise interventions. They quantified rejuvenation by measuring shifts in predicted age, with parabiosis revealing pronounced transcriptomic rejuvenation (e.g., nearly 4–5 months reversal in aNSC-NPCs) and exercise eliciting more modest effects. Additional differential expression and logistic regression classification analyses further characterized distinct gene expression responses—young blood preferentially reversed interferon-related pathways while exercise restored genes linked to proliferation and neurogenesis.

Paper's dataset description  
The dataset comprises multiple types of information that are closely intertwined with aging in the neurogenic niche. The primary dataset includes single-cell transcriptomes from 28 mice (spanning 3–29 months of age) in which each cell is annotated by its gene expression profile, cell cycle state, and cell type membership (across 11 distinct clusters). In addition, the study collected detailed metadata regarding chronological age and the measured proliferative fractions that were used to define biological age. Supplementary datasets include two independent heterochronic parabiosis cohorts and an exercise cohort, each providing single-cell RNA-seq data under defined intervention conditions. Moreover, the study leverages external datasets from other mouse brain regions and human brain samples, as well as data from the Tabula Muris Senis multi-tissue aging atlas, to underline the generalizability of the developed aging clocks. Together, these datasets form a comprehensive resource that links high-resolution transcriptomic information to cellular aging and rejuvenation processes in the brain.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: We hypothesize that mitochondrial gene expression, as indicated by percent.mt, increases with age in the aging brain and that this increase is cell type–specific, with neurogenic and microglial populations showing a stronger correlation. This suggests that mitochondrial stress may be a key feature of cellular aging in the subventricular zone.

Analysis Plan:
1. Perform an exploratory analysis by creating a scatter plot of percent.mt versus Age for all cells to visually inspect overall trends.
2. Subset the data to focus on key cell types likely involved in neurogenesis and immune response (e.g., Astrocyte_qNSC, Neuroblast_1, Neuroblast_2, Neuron, and Microglia) and generate individual scatter plots of percent.mt versus Age for each cell type.
3. For each selected cell type, compute the Pearson correlation coefficient and corresponding p-value between Age and percent.mt to quantitatively assess the correlation.
4. Arrange the cell type–specific scatter plots with their fitted regression lines in a grid layout to compare the mitochondrial expression trends across cell types.
5. Summarize the correlation statistics in a table to highlight which cell types display a significant relationship between mitochondrial gene expression and aging.

Initial Code:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Extract Age and percent.mt from the adata.obs dataframe
ages = adata.obs['Age']
percent_mt = adata.obs['percent.mt']

# Create a scatter plot of percent.mt vs Age for all cells
df = adata.obs.copy()
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
sns.scatterplot(x='Age', y='percent.mt', data=df, color='teal', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Exploratory Scatter Plot: percent.mt vs Age (All Cells)')
plt.xlabel('Chronological Age')
plt.ylabel('Percent Mitochondrial Genes (percent.mt)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that mitochondrial gene expression, as indicated by percent.mt, increases with age in the aging brain and that this increase is cell type–specific, with neurogenic and microglial populations showing a stronger correlation. This suggests that mitochondrial stress may be a key feature of cellular aging in the subventricular zone.

Analysis Plan:
['Perform an exploratory analysis by creating a scatter plot of percent.mt versus Age for all cells to visually inspect overall trends.', 'Subset the data to focus on key cell types likely involved in neurogenesis and immune response (e.g., Astrocyte_qNSC, Neuroblast_1, Neuroblast_2, Neuron, and Microglia) and generate individual scatter plots of percent.mt versus Age for each cell type.', 'For each selected cell type, compute the Pearson correlation coefficient and corresponding p-value between Age and percent.mt to quantitatively assess the correlation.', 'Arrange the cell type–specific scatter plots with their fitted regression lines in a grid layout to compare the mitochondrial expression trends across cell types.', 'Summarize the correlation statistics in a table to highlight which cell types display a significant relationship between mitochondrial gene expression and aging.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Extract Age and percent.mt from the adata.obs dataframe
ages = adata.obs['Age']
percent_mt = adata.obs['percent.mt']

# Create a scatter plot of percent.mt vs Age for all cells
df = adata.obs.copy()
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
sns.scatterplot(x='Age', y='percent.mt', data=df, color='teal', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Exploratory Scatter Plot: percent.mt vs Age (All Cells)')
plt.xlabel('Chronological Age')
plt.ylabel('Percent Mitochondrial Genes (percent.mt)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python Code:
• The code is clear and concise for producing an exploratory scatter plot of percent.mt versus Age for all cells.
• It correctly extracts the necessary metadata and uses well-supported libraries (matplotlib and seaborn) within the allowed set.
• Although the explicit extraction of 'ages' and 'percent_mt' isn’t directly used in plotting, having these variables may be useful for subsequent analyses. Consider either removing or commenting on their future purpose.
• The use of plt.tight_layout() ensures a neat figure layout, which is beneficial for presentation.
• No extraneous code is present, and the color and alpha parameters aid in visual clarity.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The hypothesis is well-defined and focused on mitochondrial gene expression changes with age, highlighting cell type–specific effects in neurogenic and microglial populations.
• The plan is structured in a logical sequence starting with an overall exploratory scatter plot and then drilling down into specific cell types.
• The inclusion of both visual (scatter plots with regression lines, grid layouts) and quantitative methods (Pearson correlation statistics) provides a robust dual approach.
• It is good that the analysis plan emphasizes the need for significance testing and detailed statistical reporting.
• Consider providing a rationale for the chosen cell types (e.g., Astrocyte_qNSC, Neuroblast_1/2, Neuron, and Microglia) and briefly explaining why these are most relevant to mitochondrial stress in aging.
• Ensure that the subsequent code for correlation testing and grid arrangement builds on this exploratory step without overlapping with previous analyses, as stated.
• Overall, the plan is distinct from the paper’s analyses while staying within the allowed computational methods and packages.

Overall, both the code and plan are well-aligned with the guidelines and the central goal of addressing mitochondrial involvement in brain aging.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: We hypothesize that mitochondrial gene expression, as indicated by percent.mt, increases with age in the aging brain and that this increase is cell type–specific. In particular, neurogenic populations (Astrocyte_qNSC, Neuroblast_1, Neuroblast_2, Neuron) and microglia will exhibit a stronger positive correlation, suggesting that mitochondrial stress might play a pivotal role in cellular aging and potentially drive divergent aging mechanisms in these distinct cell types.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Perform an exploratory analysis by creating a scatter plot of percent.mt versus Age for all cells to visually inspect overall trends.
2. Subset the data to focus on key cell types implicated in neurogenesis and immune response (specifically Astrocyte_qNSC, Neuroblast_1, Neuroblast_2, Neuron, and Microglia). These cell types are chosen based on their known roles in stem cell maintenance, neurogenesis, and neuroinflammation, processes that might be especially sensitive to mitochondrial stress during aging.
3. For each selected cell type, compute the Pearson correlation coefficient and corresponding p-value between Age and percent.mt to quantitatively assess the relationship.
4. Arrange the cell type–specific scatter plots with fitted regression lines in a grid layout for an easy visual comparison of mitochondrial expression trends across cell types.
5. Summarize the correlation statistics in a table to highlight which cell types display statistically significant correlations between mitochondrial gene expression and aging.

Revised Code:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Extract Age and percent.mt from the adata.obs dataframe
ages = adata.obs['Age']  # This variable may be used for subsequent analyses, such as correlation tests or regression modeling
percent_mt = adata.obs['percent.mt']  # Similarly, percent_mt will be useful for further statistical analysis

# Create a copy of the metadata for visualization
df = adata.obs.copy()

# Create a scatter plot of percent.mt vs Age for all cells
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
sns.scatterplot(x='Age', y='percent.mt', data=df, color='teal', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Exploratory Scatter Plot: percent.mt vs Age (All Cells)')
plt.xlabel('Chronological Age')
plt.ylabel('Percent Mitochondrial Genes (percent.mt)')
plt.tight_layout()

The scatter plot examines the relationship between mitochondrial gene expression (percent.mt) and chronological age. While the provided plot is exploratory, it is crucial to assess if changes in mitochondrial gene expression correlate with aging, as mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of aging.

### Feedback and Suggestions:

1. **Biological Relevance:**
   - Investigate whether mitochondrial gene expression (percent.mt) shows an increase or decrease with age. This could hint at cellular stress or increased mitochondrial biogenesis, both of which are aging markers.

2. **Beyond Chronological Age:**
   - Since the study focuses on both chronological and biological aging, consider overlaying biological age metrics or functional metrics such as NSC proliferative capacity on the scatter plot to check for correlations with mitochondrial gene expression.

3. **Cell Type-Specific Analysis:**
   - Extend the analysis to individual cell types instead of pooling all cells. Mitochondrial gene expression changes might be cell type-specific and may not be visible at the whole population level.

4. **Explore Pathway Enrichment:**
   - Conduct pathway enrichment analyses for cells with particularly high or low percent.mt to identify mitochondrial-related pathways involved in aging.

5. **Correlation with Aging Clocks:**
   - Explore correlations between mitochondrial gene expression levels and cell-type-specific aging clock predictions to validate whether certain cell types exhibit distinct mitochondrial aging signatures.

6. **Validation with Interventions:**
   - Utilize data from parabiosis and exercise cohorts to determine if rejuvenation interventions have any effect on percent.mt levels, compared to control groups.

7. **Refinement of Analysis:**
   - Conduct more advanced statistical tests (e.g., linear regression, ANOVA) to quantify the significance of any observed trends over age.

By delving deeper into these aspects, you can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the potential role of mitochondrial gene expression in aging and its variability across cell types and interventions.
