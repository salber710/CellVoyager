PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi-tools, scVelo, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/endo_data.h5ad
    10. If trying to use scVelo, insert the following code snippet BEFORE the "import scvelo" statement:
    import matplotlib
    class mplDeprecation(UserWarning):
        pass
    matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation = mplDeprecation
    11. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    12. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    13. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.


For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps. 

You are given the following summary of the anndata object:
Below is a description of the columns in adata.obs:

Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
This study focuses on the human endometrium—a dynamic tissue that undergoes cyclical remodeling, shedding, and regeneration during the menstrual cycle. These dramatic transformations are central to reproductive physiology, as they underlie fertility and the establishment of a receptive state for embryo implantation known as the window of implantation (WOI). The biological background of the study is rooted in understanding how different cell types within the endometrium change their gene expression profiles over the cycle, how these changes regulate tissue homeostasis, and how failures or deviations in these processes might be linked to fertility issues and endometrial diseases.

Biological background  
Relevant biological questions include deciphering the molecular signatures that define each phase of the menstrual cycle, particularly the abrupt transcriptional activation that marks the opening of the WOI. The investigation also centers on the mechanisms behind cellular differentiation, decidualization of stromal fibroblasts, and the interplay among various cell types—including ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells, stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells, and smooth muscle cells. This enhanced resolution of cellular heterogeneity paves the way for better understanding of normal reproductive physiology and provides a baseline reference for studying endometrial pathologies.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors began their investigation by applying dimensional reduction techniques (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, or t-SNE, and uniform manifold approximation, UMAP) on single-cell RNA sequencing data generated using the Fluidigm C1 platform and validated with the 10x Chromium system. They analyzed 2,148 cells from 19 healthy donors, identifying clear segregation into distinct groups. Differential expression analysis and density-based clustering revealed six major cell types—stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, unciliated epithelium, and a previously uncharacterized ciliated epithelium. In the 10x dataset of over 71,000 cells, an additional smooth muscle cell type was uncovered. The identification and characterization of these cell types, using canonical markers and newly discovered discriminatory genes (e.g., those marking ciliated epithelium), provide a comprehensive cellular atlas of the endometrium.

Paper’s computational analyses  
Next, the study employed a mutual information (MI)–based approach to build a pseudotime trajectory that connected cellular transcriptomic states across the menstrual cycle within the major endometrial cell types. By selecting “time-associated” genes, the researchers generated principal curves in t-SNE space to order cells along a continuous trajectory. This analysis revealed four distinct phases for both unciliated epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts. A striking finding was that unciliated epithelia displayed an abrupt, discontinuous transition in gene expression—marked by a rapid activation of a specific gene module that includes PAEP, GPX3, and CXCL14—corresponding to the opening of the WOI. In contrast, stromal fibroblasts showed a more gradual transition with modular upregulation of decidualization markers, underscoring different dynamics in epithelial versus stromal compartment transitions.

Paper’s computational analyses  
Further detailed analyses focused on unraveling finer cellular heterogeneity and regulatory mechanisms. The unciliated epithelium was deconvoluted into glandular and luminal subtypes based on differential expression of genes such as WNT7A, LGR5, and FOXA2; these markers correspond to previously documented differences in anatomical function and remodeling during the cycle. Additionally, the study characterized global transcription factor dynamics and secreted protein profiles by clustering dynamically expressed genes in both cell types. The team applied gene ontology enrichment to relate these expression patterns to processes like differentiation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and morphogenesis. Parallel cell cycle analyses using canonical G1/S and G2/M gene sets helped identify proliferative versus secretory phases, confirming that the transition from a high-cycling state to a quiescent, receptive state occurs between phases in both epithelia and stromal fibroblasts, thereby linking transcriptomic signatures with histological observations.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises multi-platform single-cell transcriptomic profiles derived from human endometrial biopsies collected from healthy ovum donors during a natural menstrual cycle. Specifically, 19 donors contributed samples to the Fluidigm C1 dataset (2,148 cells), while an independent validation set of ten donors was profiled using the 10x Chromium system (over 71,000 cells). Alongside cell-type–specific gene expression counts, the dataset includes metadata such as day of menstrual cycle, phase assignments based on both transcriptomic and histological criteria, and spatial data from RNAscope and immunofluorescence imaging. This rich combinatorial dataset connects molecular signatures to key reproductive events like the WOI and decidualization, serving as an essential resource for understanding normal endometrial physiology and providing a baseline for future studies on endometrial diseases and fertility treatments.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Macrophages in the endometrium exhibit significant inter-donor variability in the expression of key inflammatory genes, suggesting that donor-specific immune environments may influence endometrial function and receptivity.

Analysis Plan:
['Filter the dataset to retain only macrophage cells using the cell_type information in adata.obs.', 'Select a panel of canonical inflammatory genes (e.g., IL1B, TNF, IL6, CCL2) and verify their presence in the dataset.', 'For each donor, calculate summary statistics (mean, median) of the expression levels of these inflammatory genes.', 'Perform an ANOVA test to evaluate whether differences in the expression of these genes across donors are statistically significant.', 'Visualize the distribution of inflammatory gene expression across donors using grouped boxplots to highlight potential donor-specific effects.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Filter the AnnData object to obtain only 'Macrophages'
macrophages = adata[adata.obs['cell_type'] == 'Macrophages']

# Print basic information about the macrophage subset
print('Macrophages shape:', macrophages.shape)
print(macrophages.obs['donor'].value_counts())

# Define a list of canonical inflammatory genes
inflammatory_genes = ['IL1B', 'TNF', 'IL6', 'CCL2']

# Check which of these inflammatory genes are present in the dataset
available_genes = [gene for gene in inflammatory_genes if gene in macrophages.var_names]
print('Available inflammatory genes:', available_genes)

# For the available genes, extract the expression data and attach donor information
if available_genes:
    # If the data is in sparse format, convert to dense
    if hasattr(macrophages.X, 'A'):
        expr_data = pd.DataFrame(macrophages[:, available_genes].X.A, columns=available_genes, index=macrophages.obs_names)
    else:
        expr_data = pd.DataFrame(macrophages[:, available_genes].X, columns=available_genes, index=macrophages.obs_names)
    
    expr_data = pd.concat([expr_data, macrophages.obs[['donor']]], axis=1)
    
    # Display the first few rows of the expression data for verification
    print(expr_data.head())

    # Create a boxplot for one inflammatory gene (e.g., IL1B) across donors for an initial look
    if 'IL1B' in available_genes:
        sns.boxplot(x='donor', y='IL1B', data=expr_data)
        plt.title('IL1B Expression in Macrophages Across Donors')
        plt.xlabel('Donor')
        plt.ylabel('Expression Level')
        plt.show()
    else:
        print('IL1B not found in the available gene set.')

else:
    print('None of the specified inflammatory genes were found in the dataset.')

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python Code:
• The code correctly filters macrophages from the AnnData object, extracts donor counts, and verifies the availability of the inflammatory genes. It handles both sparse and dense expression matrices, which is good.
• The inclusion of an initial boxplot for IL1B provides a useful visual snapshot. For improved insight, consider also calculating and printing summary statistics (mean, median) per donor for each available inflammatory gene.
• To further build on this step, you might add error handling or logging in case none of the inflammatory genes are present. This ensures robustness in diverse datasets.
• Overall, the code adheres to the package restrictions and guidelines, and it is self-contained without referencing external files.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is clear and well-focused on evaluating inter-donor variability in macrophages, which is a novel angle compared to the paper’s cell phase and pseudotime analyses.
• Steps that include filtering for macrophages, checking for canonical inflammatory genes, and summarizing expression levels complement the research hypothesis effectively.
• The choice of an ANOVA test and grouped boxplots to assess donor-specific differences is appropriate. Make sure to print detailed statistical outputs (p-values, F-statistics) for clear interpretation.
• The plan might benefit from a brief rationale for selecting these specific inflammatory genes, linking them to potential immune-modulatory roles in endometrial function.
• It’s well-integrated with previous analyses but maintains a distinct focus on donor variability, fulfilling the requirement for a novel approach.

Overall, both the code and the analysis plan are concise, aligned with guidelines, and provide a strong foundation to explore the hypothesis further.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.

    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi-tools, scVelo, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/endo_data.h5ad

    import matplotlib
    class mplDeprecation(UserWarning):
        pass
    matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation = mplDeprecation
    11. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
I hypothesize that during the window of implantation (WOI), unciliated epithelial cells exhibit increased gene expression variability compared to earlier menstrual cycle phases, reflecting a heightened state of transcriptional plasticity necessary for initiating endometrial receptivity.

Analysis Plan:
["Perform an exploratory analysis by subsetting the adata object to include only unciliated epithelial cells (including all variants: 'Unciliated epithelia', 'Unciliated epithelia 1', and 'Unciliated epithelia 2').", 'Separate the subset into two groups based on the day value: pre-WOI (days less than 19) and WOI (days 19 and 20).', 'Compute per-gene expression variability (variance) within each group to quantify transcriptional heterogeneity.', "Conduct a statistical test (e.g., Levene's test) across groups to assess whether the variability differences are statistically significant for each gene.", 'Visualize the overall distribution of gene expression variance between the two groups using violin plots, and subsequently create a heatmap for the top differentially variable genes to highlight specific genes with significant variance changes.', 'Interpret the results to determine if increased variability correlates with the abrupt transition observed during WOI, providing insights into the molecular dynamics of endometrial receptivity.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Subset the data to include only unciliated epithelial cells
unciliated_types = ['Unciliated epithelia', 'Unciliated epithelia 1', 'Unciliated epithelia 2']
adata_epi = adata[adata.obs['cell_type'].isin(unciliated_types)].copy()

# Separate cells into pre-WOI (day < 19) and WOI (day >= 19) groups
pre_WOI = adata_epi[adata_epi.obs['day'] < 19].copy()
WOI = adata_epi[adata_epi.obs['day'] >= 19].copy()

# Ensure the data matrix is in dense format for variance calculation (if sparse)
if hasattr(pre_WOI.X, 'toarray'):
    X_pre = pre_WOI.X.toarray()
else:
    X_pre = pre_WOI.X

if hasattr(WOI.X, 'toarray'):
    X_WOI = WOI.X.toarray()
else:
    X_WOI = WOI.X

# Compute per-gene variance for each group
var_pre = np.var(X_pre, axis=0)
var_WOI = np.var(X_WOI, axis=0)

# Print median gene variance for each group
print('Median gene variance for pre-WOI (day < 19):', np.median(var_pre))
print('Median gene variance for WOI (day >= 19):', np.median(var_WOI))

# Optional visualization: violin plot of per-gene variance distribution in each group
var_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'pre_WOI': var_pre,
    'WOI': var_WOI
})

# Melt the dataframe for seaborn
var_df_melt = var_df.melt(var_name='Group', value_name='Gene Variance')

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.violinplot(x='Group', y='Gene Variance', data=var_df_melt, inner='quartile')
plt.title('Distribution of Gene Expression Variance in Unciliated Epithelial Cells')
plt.show()

Feedback:
Feedback on the Code:
• The subsetting of unciliated epithelial cells is implemented correctly using the provided cell type strings, and the .copy() calls ensure that downstream modifications won’t affect the original adata.
• The separation into pre‐WOI and WOI groups by day is clear and follows the given criterion. Consider validating that the “day” metadata is of numeric type.
• The conditional conversion from sparse to dense matrices is well handled; however, if the data are log-normalized or require scaling, ensure that these steps are applied prior to variance calculation.
• The calculation of per‐gene variance using np.var(axis=0) is appropriate, though you might consider comparing results with sample variance (using ddof=1) if that better reflects the variability across cells.
• The use of a melted DataFrame for the violin plot is a good approach to visualize the distribution of variances. Ensure that all figures are displayed, as required, and consider adding axis labels for clarity.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is focused and directly addresses the hypothesis by quantifying gene expression variability between pre‐WOI and WOI groups.
• The choices of cell subtypes and day thresholds are well justified and distinct from previous analyses, ensuring a novel perspective.
• Incorporating a statistical test (e.g., Levene’s test) in a later step is an excellent idea to formally assess differences in variability.
• The plan’s sequential approach—from subsetting to visualization—creates a logical workflow, yet consider discussing normalization and potential batch effects from different donors/datasets to ensure robustness.
• For added novelty, you might also explore integrating additional metadata (e.g., donor or dataset type) as covariates in future steps to further control for confounding factors.

Overall, the code and analysis plan are solid, adhere to the guidelines, and are clearly geared toward testing the stated hypothesis while building upon previous work.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.

Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
This study focuses on the human endometrium—a dynamic tissue that undergoes cyclical remodeling, shedding, and regeneration during the menstrual cycle. These dramatic transformations are central to reproductive physiology, as they underlie fertility and the establishment of a receptive state for embryo implantation known as the window of implantation (WOI). The biological background of the study is rooted in understanding how different cell types within the endometrium change their gene expression profiles over the cycle, how these changes regulate tissue homeostasis, and how failures or deviations in these processes might be linked to fertility issues and endometrial diseases.

Biological background  
Relevant biological questions include deciphering the molecular signatures that define each phase of the menstrual cycle, particularly the abrupt transcriptional activation that marks the opening of the WOI. The investigation also centers on the mechanisms behind cellular differentiation, decidualization of stromal fibroblasts, and the interplay among various cell types—including ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells, stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells, and smooth muscle cells. This enhanced resolution of cellular heterogeneity paves the way for better understanding of normal reproductive physiology and provides a baseline reference for studying endometrial pathologies.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors began their investigation by applying dimensional reduction techniques (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, or t-SNE, and uniform manifold approximation, UMAP) on single-cell RNA sequencing data generated using the Fluidigm C1 platform and validated with the 10x Chromium system. They analyzed 2,148 cells from 19 healthy donors, identifying clear segregation into distinct groups. Differential expression analysis and density-based clustering revealed six major cell types—stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, unciliated epithelium, and a previously uncharacterized ciliated epithelium. In the 10x dataset of over 71,000 cells, an additional smooth muscle cell type was uncovered. The identification and characterization of these cell types, using canonical markers and newly discovered discriminatory genes (e.g., those marking ciliated epithelium), provide a comprehensive cellular atlas of the endometrium.

Paper’s computational analyses  
Next, the study employed a mutual information (MI)–based approach to build a pseudotime trajectory that connected cellular transcriptomic states across the menstrual cycle within the major endometrial cell types. By selecting “time-associated” genes, the researchers generated principal curves in t-SNE space to order cells along a continuous trajectory. This analysis revealed four distinct phases for both unciliated epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts. A striking finding was that unciliated epithelia displayed an abrupt, discontinuous transition in gene expression—marked by a rapid activation of a specific gene module that includes PAEP, GPX3, and CXCL14—corresponding to the opening of the WOI. In contrast, stromal fibroblasts showed a more gradual transition with modular upregulation of decidualization markers, underscoring different dynamics in epithelial versus stromal compartment transitions.

Paper’s computational analyses  
Further detailed analyses focused on unraveling finer cellular heterogeneity and regulatory mechanisms. The unciliated epithelium was deconvoluted into glandular and luminal subtypes based on differential expression of genes such as WNT7A, LGR5, and FOXA2; these markers correspond to previously documented differences in anatomical function and remodeling during the cycle. Additionally, the study characterized global transcription factor dynamics and secreted protein profiles by clustering dynamically expressed genes in both cell types. The team applied gene ontology enrichment to relate these expression patterns to processes like differentiation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and morphogenesis. Parallel cell cycle analyses using canonical G1/S and G2/M gene sets helped identify proliferative versus secretory phases, confirming that the transition from a high-cycling state to a quiescent, receptive state occurs between phases in both epithelia and stromal fibroblasts, thereby linking transcriptomic signatures with histological observations.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises multi-platform single-cell transcriptomic profiles derived from human endometrial biopsies collected from healthy ovum donors during a natural menstrual cycle. Specifically, 19 donors contributed samples to the Fluidigm C1 dataset (2,148 cells), while an independent validation set of ten donors was profiled using the 10x Chromium system (over 71,000 cells). Alongside cell-type–specific gene expression counts, the dataset includes metadata such as day of menstrual cycle, phase assignments based on both transcriptomic and histological criteria, and spatial data from RNAscope and immunofluorescence imaging. This rich combinatorial dataset connects molecular signatures to key reproductive events like the WOI and decidualization, serving as an essential resource for understanding normal endometrial physiology and providing a baseline for future studies on endometrial diseases and fertility treatments.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Within the endometrial lymphocyte population, coordinated regulatory modules emerge during the menstrual cycle that correlate with cycle day and may influence endometrial receptivity by modulating immune responses.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the dataset to focus on lymphocytes, a cell type not extensively analyzed in previous studies, to uncover novel immune regulatory patterns.', 'Normalize and log-transform the lymphocyte data, then identify highly variable genes to capture the most informative transcriptional signals.', 'Perform PCA to explore the major axes of variation in lymphocytes and assess how these correlate with cycle day.', 'Construct a gene-gene correlation matrix using the top variable genes and apply hierarchical clustering to delineate co-expression modules.', 'Compute module eigengenes for each gene module and perform Spearman correlation tests with cycle day to statistically validate temporal trends.', 'Visualize the results by creating heatmaps of the correlation matrix and scatter plots highlighting significant relationships between module eigengenes and cycle day.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import pandas as pd

# Subset the AnnData object to lymphocytes
adata_lymph = adata[adata.obs['cell_type'] == 'Lymphocytes'].copy()

# Normalize the data and log-transform
sc.pp.normalize_total(adata_lymph, target_sum=1e4)
sc.pp.log1p(adata_lymph)

# Identify the top 1000 highly variable genes within lymphocytes
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata_lymph, n_top_genes=1000, flavor='seurat')

# Visualize the highly variable genes to ensure quality assessment
sc.pl.highly_variable_genes(adata_lymph, show=True)

Feedback:
Feedback on Code:
1. The subsetting of lymphocytes and subsequent normalization, log-transformation, and variable gene selection are implemented correctly using Scanpy functions.
2. Ensure you retain the list of highly variable genes (stored in adata_lymph.var['highly_variable']) for downstream analyses. This can simplify later steps when filtering for module construction.
3. The visualization step for highly variable genes is correctly included, and it immediately displays the plot as required. Optionally, consider adding a title or axis labels for clarity in the plot.
4. All function parameters (e.g., target_sum=1e4, n_top_genes=1000, flavor='seurat') align well with standard single-cell RNA-seq preprocessing practices.

Feedback on Analysis Plan:
1. The plan is well-structured and novel by specifically targeting lymphocytes—cell types not deeply analyzed in the original publication—and linking gene regulatory modules to cycle day.
2. The proposed downstream analyses (PCA, hierarchical clustering of gene-gene correlations, and computation of module eigengenes) are appropriate for uncovering the coordinated regulatory signals.
3. Leveraging Spearman correlation tests for module eigengenes against cycle day is a robust approach; ensure that the tests’ outputs and significance values are printed for clear interpretation.
4. The visualization guidelines (heatmaps and scatter plots) neatly tie the analytical results to biological relevance. Consider arranging multiple figures in a grid when displaying multiple plots for easier comparison.
5. The plan avoids overlap with previous analyses and the paper’s methods by focusing on lymphocyte-specific regulatory patterns, which is a strength of this approach.
6. Finally, ensure that each step remains self-contained using only the metadata and features present in the anndata object, as required by the guidelines.

Overall, both the code and the analysis plan are thoughtfully constructed, align with the coding guidelines, and pave the way for novel biological insights while minimizing redundancy with prior work.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi-tools, scVelo, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Smooth muscle cells undergo metabolic reprogramming during the menstrual cycle, with the expression of key metabolic genes significantly correlating with cycle day. This metabolic shift may be critical in orchestrating endometrial remodeling.

Analysis Plan:
['Filter the complete dataset to isolate smooth muscle cells using the cell_type metadata.', 'Explore the distribution of menstrual cycle days in the smooth muscle cell subset to understand temporal sampling and natural variation.', 'Select a curated list of metabolic genes (e.g., ACACA, CPT1A, PPARGC1A, LDHA) that are known to play roles in energy metabolism and tissue remodeling.', 'Investigate the correlation between the expression of these metabolic markers and the cycle day using Pearson correlation tests to statistically assess their relationship.', 'Visualize the results by creating scatter plots with regression lines for each metabolic gene and arranging the figures in a grid layout, alongside displaying the corresponding statistical measures.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

# Subset the AnnData object for smooth muscle cells
sm_adata = adata[adata.obs['cell_type'] == 'Smooth muscle cells'].copy()

# Plot the distribution of cycle day for smooth muscle cells
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
sns.histplot(sm_adata.obs['day'], bins=10, kde=True, color='skyblue')
plt.title('Distribution of Cycle Day in Smooth Muscle Cells')
plt.xlabel('Cycle Day')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

# Print out basic information about the smooth muscle cell subset
print('Smooth muscle cell subset shape:', sm_adata.shape)

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python Code:
• The code correctly subsets the AnnData object for smooth muscle cells and copies the result, ensuring that any downstream modifications are isolated.
• Using seaborn’s histplot with kernel density estimation to visualize the distribution of cycle days is appropriate and the chosen figure settings (size, color, labels) enhance clarity.
• Good practice is shown by printing out the shape of the subset, confirming the correct extraction of cells.
• Consider adding simple error or value checks (e.g., verifying non-empty 'day' column) or summary statistics to ensure data quality during filtering.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is clearly focused on a novel hypothesis—investigating metabolic reprogramming in smooth muscle cells over the menstrual cycle—which is distinct from both the research paper and previous analyses.
• The stepwise breakdown (filtering smooth muscle cells, exploring cycle day distribution, then correlating curated metabolic gene expression with cycle day) is logical and ensures a self-contained analysis.
• Including Pearson correlation tests and corresponding visualizations with regression lines is a robust approach to statistically substantiate the findings.
• Future steps would benefit from considering additional stratifications (such as donor-level variability) to strengthen the biological insights without overlapping previous immune cell analyses.
• The plan stays within the permitted package set and uses metadata efficiently, which aligns well with the provided guidelines.

Overall, both the code and analysis plan are well-structured, focused, and adhere to the specified guidelines.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:

PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.

    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps.

Here are the previous analyses attempted:
The updated analysis refines the exploration of inter-donor variability in macrophage inflammatory gene expression by including detailed summary statistics and enhanced visualizations, thereby providing a robust foundation for subsequent statistical testing and deeper biological insights.
The analysis initiates the investigation of gene expression variability differences in unciliated epithelial cells across the menstrual cycle phases, focusing on the WOI. Future work will integrate statistical testing and additional corrections for normalization and potential confounding factors.
The analysis pipeline aims to uncover novel immune regulatory signals in lymphocytes by correlating gene expression modules with cycle day, setting the stage for downstream dimensionality reduction, clustering, and statistical validation.
The analysis begins with careful subsetting and quality control to ensure that smooth muscle cells are accurately identified and that their cycle day metadata is robust. This foundational step sets the stage for subsequent investigations into the correlation between key metabolic gene expressions and cycle day, while also considering donor variability.


Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
This study focuses on the human endometrium—a dynamic tissue that undergoes cyclical remodeling, shedding, and regeneration during the menstrual cycle. These dramatic transformations are central to reproductive physiology, as they underlie fertility and the establishment of a receptive state for embryo implantation known as the window of implantation (WOI). The biological background of the study is rooted in understanding how different cell types within the endometrium change their gene expression profiles over the cycle, how these changes regulate tissue homeostasis, and how failures or deviations in these processes might be linked to fertility issues and endometrial diseases.

Biological background  
Relevant biological questions include deciphering the molecular signatures that define each phase of the menstrual cycle, particularly the abrupt transcriptional activation that marks the opening of the WOI. The investigation also centers on the mechanisms behind cellular differentiation, decidualization of stromal fibroblasts, and the interplay among various cell types—including ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells, stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells, and smooth muscle cells. This enhanced resolution of cellular heterogeneity paves the way for better understanding of normal reproductive physiology and provides a baseline reference for studying endometrial pathologies.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors began their investigation by applying dimensional reduction techniques (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, or t-SNE, and uniform manifold approximation, UMAP) on single-cell RNA sequencing data generated using the Fluidigm C1 platform and validated with the 10x Chromium system. They analyzed 2,148 cells from 19 healthy donors, identifying clear segregation into distinct groups. Differential expression analysis and density-based clustering revealed six major cell types—stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, unciliated epithelium, and a previously uncharacterized ciliated epithelium. In the 10x dataset of over 71,000 cells, an additional smooth muscle cell type was uncovered. The identification and characterization of these cell types, using canonical markers and newly discovered discriminatory genes (e.g., those marking ciliated epithelium), provide a comprehensive cellular atlas of the endometrium.

Paper’s computational analyses  
Next, the study employed a mutual information (MI)–based approach to build a pseudotime trajectory that connected cellular transcriptomic states across the menstrual cycle within the major endometrial cell types. By selecting “time-associated” genes, the researchers generated principal curves in t-SNE space to order cells along a continuous trajectory. This analysis revealed four distinct phases for both unciliated epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts. A striking finding was that unciliated epithelia displayed an abrupt, discontinuous transition in gene expression—marked by a rapid activation of a specific gene module that includes PAEP, GPX3, and CXCL14—corresponding to the opening of the WOI. In contrast, stromal fibroblasts showed a more gradual transition with modular upregulation of decidualization markers, underscoring different dynamics in epithelial versus stromal compartment transitions.

Paper’s computational analyses  
Further detailed analyses focused on unraveling finer cellular heterogeneity and regulatory mechanisms. The unciliated epithelium was deconvoluted into glandular and luminal subtypes based on differential expression of genes such as WNT7A, LGR5, and FOXA2; these markers correspond to previously documented differences in anatomical function and remodeling during the cycle. Additionally, the study characterized global transcription factor dynamics and secreted protein profiles by clustering dynamically expressed genes in both cell types. The team applied gene ontology enrichment to relate these expression patterns to processes like differentiation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and morphogenesis. Parallel cell cycle analyses using canonical G1/S and G2/M gene sets helped identify proliferative versus secretory phases, confirming that the transition from a high-cycling state to a quiescent, receptive state occurs between phases in both epithelia and stromal fibroblasts, thereby linking transcriptomic signatures with histological observations.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises multi-platform single-cell transcriptomic profiles derived from human endometrial biopsies collected from healthy ovum donors during a natural menstrual cycle. Specifically, 19 donors contributed samples to the Fluidigm C1 dataset (2,148 cells), while an independent validation set of ten donors was profiled using the 10x Chromium system (over 71,000 cells). Alongside cell-type–specific gene expression counts, the dataset includes metadata such as day of menstrual cycle, phase assignments based on both transcriptomic and histological criteria, and spatial data from RNAscope and immunofluorescence imaging. This rich combinatorial dataset connects molecular signatures to key reproductive events like the WOI and decidualization, serving as an essential resource for understanding normal endometrial physiology and providing a baseline for future studies on endometrial diseases and fertility treatments.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
The gene co-expression network in stromal fibroblasts is significantly rewired during the window of implantation (WOI), reflecting a shift in regulatory interactions that may underlie successful decidualization and tissue remodeling.

Analysis Plan:
["Subset the AnnData object to include only stromal fibroblasts and stratify these cells into WOI and non‐WOI groups based on the 'day' metadata (defining WOI as cycle days between 10 and 16).", 'Perform exploratory analysis on the cell distribution across cycle days for stromal fibroblasts to ensure adequate representation of both groups and visualize the cell count distributions.', 'Identify highly variable genes within the stromal fibroblast subset by calculating gene expression variance and selecting the top 50 variable genes, making sure to filter by expression percentage.', 'Compute pairwise Pearson correlation matrices for the selected genes separately for the WOI and non-WOI groups, which will reveal the underlying co-expression networks.', 'Apply a statistical test (e.g., Mann–Whitney U test) to compare the distribution of correlation coefficients between the two groups to assess significant network rewiring.', 'Visualize the correlation matrices as heatmaps arranged in a grid, annotating differences between the WOI and non-WOI networks, and interpret these differences in the context of endometrial remodeling.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Subset the data to stromal fibroblasts
adata_stromal = adata[adata.obs['cell_type'] == 'Stromal fibroblasts'].copy()

# Define WOI and non-WOI groups based on cycle day
# Assuming WOI as cycle days between 10 and 16 (inclusive)
def assign_cycle_group(day):
    if day >= 10 and day <= 16:
        return 'WOI'
    else:
        return 'non_WOI'

adata_stromal.obs['cycle_group'] = adata_stromal.obs['day'].apply(assign_cycle_group)

# Count number of cells per group
group_counts = adata_stromal.obs['cycle_group'].value_counts()
print('Cell counts by cycle group in stromal fibroblasts:')
print(group_counts)

# Plot distribution of cycle days as a histogram

plt.xlabel('Cycle Group')
plt.ylabel('Cell Count')
plt.xticks(rotation=0)
plt.show()

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python Code:
• The code accurately subsets the AnnData object to stromal fibroblasts and assigns cells to WOI/non‐WOI groups based on cycle day, following the plan and guidelines.
• The use of the assign_cycle_group function is clear, though consider using a lambda function for brevity if preferred.
• Visualization commands for the histogram and bar plot are well implemented; however, ensure the bin range in the histogram (bins=range(3, 22)) truly encompasses all available cycle day values.
• It would be useful to include an assert statement or a quick check confirming that the “day” column exists and contains numeric data before subsetting.
• Overall, the code adheres to the specified package limitations and coding guidelines.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The hypothesis focusing on gene co-expression network rewiring in stromal fibroblasts during WOI is novel and well-aligned with the central question.
• The plan clearly differentiates cells by cycle day and sets up a logical progression from exploratory analyses to network construction and statistical testing.
• Including exploratory visualizations (cell distribution histograms and group bar plots) at the outset provides a robust quality check.
• The selection of top variable genes and the subsequent pairwise Pearson correlation matrix per group is appropriate; however, detail regarding the filtering criteria for gene expression (e.g., minimum percentage of expressing cells) could be more explicit.
• Using the Mann–Whitney U test to compare correlation distributions is a sound statistical approach, ensuring that the analysis infers significant network rewiring.
• Future steps involving grid-arranged heatmaps and network annotations demonstrate a thoughtful plan for data interpretation.
• Overall, the pipeline builds logically on prior analyses, maintains focus on stromal fibroblasts, and adheres to guidelines while advancing a novel computational viewpoint.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.

Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
This study focuses on the human endometrium—a dynamic tissue that undergoes cyclical remodeling, shedding, and regeneration during the menstrual cycle. These dramatic transformations are central to reproductive physiology, as they underlie fertility and the establishment of a receptive state for embryo implantation known as the window of implantation (WOI). The biological background of the study is rooted in understanding how different cell types within the endometrium change their gene expression profiles over the cycle, how these changes regulate tissue homeostasis, and how failures or deviations in these processes might be linked to fertility issues and endometrial diseases.

Relevant biological questions include deciphering the molecular signatures that define each phase of the menstrual cycle, particularly the abrupt transcriptional activation that marks the opening of the WOI. The investigation also centers on the mechanisms behind cellular differentiation, decidualization of stromal fibroblasts, and the interplay among various cell types—including ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells, stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells, and smooth muscle cells.

They analyzed 2,148 cells from 19 healthy donors, identifying clear segregation into distinct groups. Differential expression analysis and density-based clustering revealed six major cell types—stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, unciliated epithelium, and a previously uncharacterized ciliated epithelium. In the 10x dataset of over 71,000 cells, an additional smooth muscle cell type was uncovered. The identification and characterization of these cell types, using canonical markers and newly discovered discriminatory genes (e.g., those marking ciliated epithelium), provide a comprehensive cellular atlas of the endometrium.

import pandas as pd

# Subset the anndata object to only include endothelial cells
endothelial_adata = adata[adata.obs['cell_type'] == 'Endothelia'].copy()

# Display basic information about the endothelial subset
print('Number of endothelial cells:', endothelial_adata.n_obs)
print('Observations in endothelial adata:')
print(endothelial_adata.obs.head())

# Optionally, check distribution of cycle day in endothelial cells
print('Distribution of cycle days in endothelial cells:')
print(pd.crosstab(endothelial_adata.obs['day'], endothelial_adata.obs['cell_type']))

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python Code for Step 1:
• The code correctly subsets the anndata object to endothelial cells and uses .copy() to avoid view-related issues. This approach follows best practices.
• Using print statements for basic info and summary statistics is appropriate for an exploratory step; however, consider including a simple visual (e.g., a histogram of the 'day' distribution via matplotlib) to complement the tabular crosstab, which would provide a more intuitive understanding of the cycle day spread.
• Ensure consistency with metadata values (the code filters for 'Endothelia' which appears correct based on the provided summary).

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The hypothesis is clearly stated and the plan is well organized into distinct analytical steps. It appropriately leverages the metadata available in the anndata (e.g. 'cell_type' and 'day') to explore temporal remodeling in gene co-expression networks.
• The plan is distinct from previous analyses and avoids overlap with the research paper by focusing on dynamic changes in endothelial cells specifically, rather than other cell types or pseudotime trajectories already explored.
• Consider integrating statistical tests to quantify differences in network topology (e.g., tests for differences in network density) in step 4 since printing these results will add clarity to the significance of the network remodeling.
• In subsequent steps, ensure that visualizations (such as side-by-side heatmaps in a grid layout) clearly illustrate the differences and provide appropriate statistical annotations.
• Overall, the planned novel focus on endothelial cells and temporal segmentation between early and late cycle phases is compelling and well-aligned with the hypothesis.

Both the code and the analysis plan are solid starting points. Enhancements in visualization and statistical rigor in later steps will strengthen the overall workflow.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi-tools, scVelo, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/endo_data.h5ad
    10. If trying to use scVelo, insert the following code snippet BEFORE the "import scvelo" statement:
    import matplotlib
    class mplDeprecation(UserWarning):
        pass
    matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation = mplDeprecation
    11. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    12. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    13. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.


You are given the following summary of the anndata object:

Here are the previous analyses attempted:
The updated analysis refines the exploration of inter-donor variability in macrophage inflammatory gene expression by including detailed summary statistics and enhanced visualizations, thereby providing a robust foundation for subsequent statistical testing and deeper biological insights.
The analysis initiates the investigation of gene expression variability differences in unciliated epithelial cells across the menstrual cycle phases, focusing on the WOI. Future work will integrate statistical testing and additional corrections for normalization and potential confounding factors.
The analysis pipeline aims to uncover novel immune regulatory signals in lymphocytes by correlating gene expression modules with cycle day, setting the stage for downstream dimensionality reduction, clustering, and statistical validation.
The analysis begins with careful subsetting and quality control to ensure that smooth muscle cells are accurately identified and that their cycle day metadata is robust. This foundational step sets the stage for subsequent investigations into the correlation between key metabolic gene expressions and cycle day, while also considering donor variability.
The updated analysis focuses on verifying the metadata, subsetting stromal fibroblasts, and effectively visualizing cell distributions across cycle days to set the stage for subsequent exploration of gene variability and co-expression network rewiring during WOI.
The updated analysis initiates by isolating endothelial cells and enriching the exploratory analysis with a visual histogram, thereby establishing a robust baseline to further investigate temporal remodeling in gene co-expression networks across the menstrual cycle.


Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
This study focuses on the human endometrium—a dynamic tissue that undergoes cyclical remodeling, shedding, and regeneration during the menstrual cycle. These dramatic transformations are central to reproductive physiology, as they underlie fertility and the establishment of a receptive state for embryo implantation known as the window of implantation (WOI). The biological background of the study is rooted in understanding how different cell types within the endometrium change their gene expression profiles over the cycle, how these changes regulate tissue homeostasis, and how failures or deviations in these processes might be linked to fertility issues and endometrial diseases.

Biological background  
Relevant biological questions include deciphering the molecular signatures that define each phase of the menstrual cycle, particularly the abrupt transcriptional activation that marks the opening of the WOI. The investigation also centers on the mechanisms behind cellular differentiation, decidualization of stromal fibroblasts, and the interplay among various cell types—including ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells, stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells, and smooth muscle cells. This enhanced resolution of cellular heterogeneity paves the way for better understanding of normal reproductive physiology and provides a baseline reference for studying endometrial pathologies.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors began their investigation by applying dimensional reduction techniques (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, or t-SNE, and uniform manifold approximation, UMAP) on single-cell RNA sequencing data generated using the Fluidigm C1 platform and validated with the 10x Chromium system. They analyzed 2,148 cells from 19 healthy donors, identifying clear segregation into distinct groups. Differential expression analysis and density-based clustering revealed six major cell types—stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, unciliated epithelium, and a previously uncharacterized ciliated epithelium. In the 10x dataset of over 71,000 cells, an additional smooth muscle cell type was uncovered. The identification and characterization of these cell types, using canonical markers and newly discovered discriminatory genes (e.g., those marking ciliated epithelium), provide a comprehensive cellular atlas of the endometrium.

Paper’s computational analyses  
Next, the study employed a mutual information (MI)–based approach to build a pseudotime trajectory that connected cellular transcriptomic states across the menstrual cycle within the major endometrial cell types. By selecting “time-associated” genes, the researchers generated principal curves in t-SNE space to order cells along a continuous trajectory. This analysis revealed four distinct phases for both unciliated epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts. A striking finding was that unciliated epithelia displayed an abrupt, discontinuous transition in gene expression—marked by a rapid activation of a specific gene module that includes PAEP, GPX3, and CXCL14—corresponding to the opening of the WOI. In contrast, stromal fibroblasts showed a more gradual transition with modular upregulation of decidualization markers, underscoring different dynamics in epithelial versus stromal compartment transitions.

Paper’s computational analyses  
Further detailed analyses focused on unraveling finer cellular heterogeneity and regulatory mechanisms. The unciliated epithelium was deconvoluted into glandular and luminal subtypes based on differential expression of genes such as WNT7A, LGR5, and FOXA2; these markers correspond to previously documented differences in anatomical function and remodeling during the cycle. Additionally, the study characterized global transcription factor dynamics and secreted protein profiles by clustering dynamically expressed genes in both cell types. The team applied gene ontology enrichment to relate these expression patterns to processes like differentiation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and morphogenesis. Parallel cell cycle analyses using canonical G1/S and G2/M gene sets helped identify proliferative versus secretory phases, confirming that the transition from a high-cycling state to a quiescent, receptive state occurs between phases in both epithelia and stromal fibroblasts, thereby linking transcriptomic signatures with histological observations.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises multi-platform single-cell transcriptomic profiles derived from human endometrial biopsies collected from healthy ovum donors during a natural menstrual cycle. Specifically, 19 donors contributed samples to the Fluidigm C1 dataset (2,148 cells), while an independent validation set of ten donors was profiled using the 10x Chromium system (over 71,000 cells). Alongside cell-type–specific gene expression counts, the dataset includes metadata such as day of menstrual cycle, phase assignments based on both transcriptomic and histological criteria, and spatial data from RNAscope and immunofluorescence imaging. This rich combinatorial dataset connects molecular signatures to key reproductive events like the WOI and decidualization, serving as an essential resource for understanding normal endometrial physiology and providing a baseline for future studies on endometrial diseases and fertility treatments.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Ciliated endometrial cells exhibit dynamic RNA velocity changes across the menstrual cycle that correlate with the progression towards a receptive state, suggesting that their splicing kinetics and dynamic gene regulation are key modulators of endometrial remodeling.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the complete dataset to extract only the ciliated cell population using the cell_type metadata.', 'Preprocess the RNA count data for the ciliated cells by filtering, normalizing, and preparing the dataset for RNA velocity analysis.', 'Utilize scVelo in its dynamical mode to compute RNA velocity vectors and latent time, capturing the splicing kinetics in ciliated cells.', 'Visualize the computed RNA velocity on a UMAP embedding for the ciliated cell subset, displaying the velocity vectors in a grid of figures.', "Perform a statistical analysis by correlating the inferred latent time with the menstrual cycle day (from the 'day' metadata) using Spearman correlation, and print the correlation coefficient and p-value.", 'Generate boxplots to compare the distribution of RNA velocity magnitudes between early and late cycle stages (based on the median cycle day) within the ciliated cells.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
ciliated_adata = adata[adata.obs['cell_type'] == 'Ciliated'].copy()
print('Number of ciliated cells:', ciliated_adata.n_obs)
print(ciliated_adata.obs[['cell_name', 'cell_type', 'day', 'donor']].head())

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python Code:
• The code correctly subsets the AnnData object for ciliated cells using the “cell_type” metadata and uses .copy() to avoid potential view issues.
• Printing the number of cells and key metadata columns is a good sanity check.
• Consider adding brief comments to clarify the purpose of each line for future readability.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is well-structured and aligns with the hypothesis by focusing on dynamic RNA velocity changes in ciliated endometrial cells.
• It clearly delineates each step—from subsetting and preprocessing to scVelo’s dynamical mode analysis and subsequent correlation tests—ensuring minimal overlap with previous work and the research paper.
• The strategy to correlate latent time with cycle day and compare RNA velocity distributions between early and late stages is novel and leverages the available metadata effectively.
• Future steps should ensure that all visualizations (e.g., velocity grids and boxplots) are organized as specified, and that any statistical test outputs are printed for transparency.
• Overall, the plan is self-contained, uses permitted packages, and builds appropriately on past analyses without duplicating prior efforts.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.

["Subset the single-cell dataset to include only endothelial cells using the 'cell_type' metadata, ensuring analysis focuses on cells pivotal for vascular remodeling.", 'Identify highly variable genes within the endothelial subset to capture the most informative expression changes, thereby reducing noise in downstream network analysis.', "Group the endothelial cells into three cyclical phases (early: days 4, 7, 9; mid: days 10, 11, 15; late: days 16, 17, 19, 20) based on the 'day' metadata to enable temporal comparison of network structure.", 'For each cycle phase, compute the Pearson correlation matrix for the highly variable genes and calculate summary network connectivity statistics (e.g., the mean absolute correlation) to quantitatively assess network rewiring.', 'Visualize the correlation matrices as heatmaps arranged in a grid for the different phases, and use statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis) to determine if the changes in network connectivity across phases are statistically significant.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc

# Subset the AnnData object to include only endothelial cells
endothelial_adata = adata[adata.obs['cell_type'] == 'Endothelia'].copy()

# Output the number of endothelial cells to confirm subsetting
print(f'Number of endothelial cells: {endothelial_adata.n_obs}')

Feedback:
Feedback on Code:
• The subsetting operation is correctly performed and the use of .copy() ensures that downstream modifications do not affect the original AnnData object.
• Consider adding a comment or assertion to verify that the 'cell_type' metadata contains the exact string "Endothelia" (e.g., checking unique values) to guard against potential typos or unexpected labeling.
• While printing the number of cells is helpful, a quick histogram of cycle days (using endothelial_adata.obs['day']) could further validate that the subset captures a representative distribution across the menstrual cycle.

Feedback on Analysis Plan:
• The plan is well-structured, with clear steps that build on previous analyses while exploring a novel angle (gene co-expression network rewiring).
• The grouping of cells into cyclical phases based on day metadata is appropriate. Ensure that downstream coding assigns phases robustly, taking into account any potential inconsistencies in the 'day' values.
• Computing Pearson correlation matrices and deriving network connectivity metrics is a novel approach compared to previous attempts; however, consider additional controls for donor variability as well.
• The plan’s emphasis on visualization (heatmaps arranged in a grid) and use of statistical tests for significance adds strength. Be sure to integrate these elements cohesively with the isolated endothelial cell dataset.
• Overall, ensure that each step is self-contained and builds logically from the previous ones, taking full advantage of the metadata for robust interpretation.

Overall, both the code snippet and analysis plan are on track. Minor enhancements for verification and visualization early on would further strengthen the analysis pipeline.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi-tools, scVelo, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/endo_data.h5ad
    10. If trying to use scVelo, insert the following code snippet BEFORE the "import scvelo" statement:
    import matplotlib
    class mplDeprecation(UserWarning):
        pass
    matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation = mplDeprecation
    11. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    12. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    13. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.


You are given the following summary of the anndata object:
Below is a description of the columns in adata.obs: 
Column cell_name contains the values ['14_AAACCCAAGTAATACG' '14_AAACCCAGTCCTTAAG' '14_AAACGAAAGGCGATAC'
 '14_AAACGCTAGACTGTTC' '14_AAACGCTAGAGTGTTA' '14_AAACGCTAGTCTAGCT'
 '14_AAACGCTGTTGTGGCC' '14_AAACGCTTCTTGCAGA' '14_AAAGAACAGCTCCGAC'
 '14_AAAGAACAGGTACTGG'] 
Column cell_type contains the values ['Ciliated' 'Endothelia' 'Lymphocytes' 'Macrophages' 'Smooth muscle cells'
 'Stromal fibroblasts' 'Unciliated epithelia' 'Unciliated epithelia 1'
 'Unciliated epithelia 2'] 
Column dataset contains the values ['10x' 'C1'] 
Column day contains the values [ 4  7  9 10 11 15 16 17 19 20] 
Column donor contains the values [ 4  5  6  7  8 11 12 13 14 15] 


Here is the code from the last 3 steps. Make sure the modified code builds on the past analyses and doesn't repeat any of them:
