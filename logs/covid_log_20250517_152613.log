PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps. 

You are given the following summary of the anndata object:

Here are the previous analyses attempted:


Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
The paper focuses on severe COVID-19, a condition induced by SARS‑CoV‑2 infection that, in a subset of patients, progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.

Biological background  
Key biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.

Paper’s computational analyses  
A series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: In severe COVID‐19 patients, key immune cells (particularly CD14 Monocytes and dendritic cells) exhibit stronger coordination between antigen presentation (HLA1) and interferon response (IFN1) compared to healthy controls, suggesting dysregulated immune signaling that could contribute to disease severity.

Analysis Plan:
1. Subset the dataset to focus on immune cell types most relevant for antigen presentation and interferon response, namely CD14 Monocytes and DC, using the 'cell_type_coarse' metadata.
2. Further split the subsets by disease status (COVID vs Healthy) to allow comparison of the expression patterns of the HLA1 and IFN1 genes.
3. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficients between HLA1 and IFN1 expression within each subset and condition to quantify the level of coordination between these markers.
4. Perform a statistical comparison using Fisher’s z-transformation to assess whether the correlation coefficients in COVID samples are significantly different from those in healthy controls.
5. Visualize the results using scatter plots arranged in a grid layout for each cell type and condition, overlaying the Pearson correlation and regression lines to aid the interpretation of the differential coupling.

Initial Code:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scanpy as sc

# Focus on two cell types: 'CD14 Monocyte' and 'DC'
cell_types_of_interest = ['CD14 Monocyte', 'DC']

# Create a dictionary to hold subset summaries
subset_info = {}

for cell_type in cell_types_of_interest:
    # subset adata for given cell type
    subset = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == cell_type]
    # Count number of cells per Status in the cell type
    counts = pd.value_counts(subset.obs['Status'])
    subset_info[cell_type] = counts.to_dict()

# Print the counts to verify the subsetting
print('Cell type counts by Status:', subset_info)

# Optionally, visualize a simple violin plot for HLA1 to see its distribution in these subtypes
sc.pl.violin(adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'].isin(cell_types_of_interest)], keys='HLA1', groupby='Status', show=True)

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
In severe COVID‐19 patients, key immune cells (particularly CD14 Monocytes and dendritic cells) exhibit stronger coordination between antigen presentation (HLA1) and interferon response (IFN1) compared to healthy controls, suggesting dysregulated immune signaling that could contribute to disease severity.

Analysis Plan:
["Subset the dataset to focus on immune cell types most relevant for antigen presentation and interferon response, namely CD14 Monocytes and DC, using the 'cell_type_coarse' metadata.", 'Further split the subsets by disease status (COVID vs Healthy) to allow comparison of the expression patterns of the HLA1 and IFN1 genes.', 'Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficients between HLA1 and IFN1 expression within each subset and condition to quantify the level of coordination between these markers.', 'Perform a statistical comparison using Fisher’s z-transformation to assess whether the correlation coefficients in COVID samples are significantly different from those in healthy controls.', 'Visualize the results using scatter plots arranged in a grid layout for each cell type and condition, overlaying the Pearson correlation and regression lines to aid the interpretation of the differential coupling.']

# Optionally, visualize a simple violin plot for HLA1 to see its distribution in these subtypes
sc.pl.violin(adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'].isin(cell_types_of_interest)], keys='HLA1', groupby='Status', show=True)

Feedback:
Feedback on the Code:
• The code correctly subsets the anndata object by the two immune cell types of interest and prints the count of cells per “Status,” which is a good first step.
• Using pd.value_counts to inspect the distribution of COVID and Healthy cells in each subset is informative; however, consider adding inline comments to explain each step clearly for long‐term reproducibility.
• When generating the violin plot, you subset adata again using isin(cell_types_of_interest) – it might be clearer to reuse your previously defined subsets if preferred.
• Although the current focus is on HLA1 distribution, note that future steps will involve IFN1 and correlation analysis. Adding a placeholder comment for upcoming steps (e.g., “# TODO: Further split subsets by disease and calculate Pearson correlations”) could improve clarity.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is well aligned with the hypothesis and focuses specifically on immune cell coordination regarding antigen presentation (HLA1) and interferon response (IFN1), which makes it distinct from analyses in the original paper.
• Subsetting the dataset for CD14 Monocytes and DC, and stratifying by disease status first, is appropriate. Ensure that any future analyses explicitly check that sufficient cell numbers exist in each subgroup for reliable statistical testing.
• Using Pearson correlation followed by Fisher’s z-transformation for comparing the correlations is a rigorous method; be sure to print out the p-values and confidence intervals for clear interpretation.
• The visualization plan (using scatter plots with regression lines arranged in a grid layout) will effectively communicate the results. Just ensure that the final figures are self-contained and clearly annotated.
• Overall, your plan is concise, directly tests the hypothesis, and employs novel metrics compared to the previous analyses. It adheres to the guideline of being self-contained and using only allowed packages.

Overall, both the provided code and analysis plan are on the right track. Small improvements in code clarity and explicit linking of steps to the hypothesis will further strengthen your analysis.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: In severe COVID‐19 patients, key immune cells (particularly CD14 Monocytes and dendritic cells) exhibit stronger coordination between antigen presentation (HLA1) and interferon response (IFN1) compared to healthy controls, suggesting dysregulated immune signaling that could contribute to disease severity.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Subset the dataset to focus on immune cell types most relevant for antigen presentation and interferon response, namely CD14 Monocytes and DC, using the 'cell_type_coarse' metadata.
2. Further split the subsets by disease status (COVID vs Healthy) to allow comparison of the expression patterns of the HLA1 and IFN1 genes.
3. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficients between HLA1 and IFN1 expression within each subset and condition to quantify the level of coordination between these markers.
4. Perform a statistical comparison using Fisher’s z-transformation to assess whether the correlation coefficients in COVID samples are significantly different from those in healthy controls.
5. Visualize the results using scatter plots arranged in a grid layout for each cell type and condition, overlaying the Pearson correlation and regression lines to aid the interpretation of the differential coupling.

Revised Code:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scanpy as sc

# Define the cell types of interest for antigen presentation and interferon response
cell_types_of_interest = ['CD14 Monocyte', 'DC']

# Create dictionaries to store subset summaries and the subset objects themselves for reuse
subset_info = {}
subset_objects = {}

# Loop through each cell type to subset data and count cells per disease Status
for cell_type in cell_types_of_interest:
    # Subset the anndata object for the current cell type
    subset = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == cell_type]
    subset_objects[cell_type] = subset  # store subset for potential future reuse
    
    # Compute the counts of cells by 'Status' (COVID vs Healthy) within this subset
    counts = pd.value_counts(subset.obs['Status'])
    subset_info[cell_type] = counts.to_dict()

# Print the counts to verify subsetting by cell type and Status
print('Cell type counts by Status:', subset_info)

# Visualize the distribution of HLA1 expression in the combined subset of CD14 Monocyte and DC
# Here, we reuse the cell types of interest for subsetting
subset_violin = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'].isin(cell_types_of_interest)]
sc.pl.violin(subset_violin, keys='HLA1', groupby='Status', show=True)

# TODO: Further split subsets by disease status and calculate Pearson correlations between HLA1 and IFN1 expression for each group

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current analysis shows significant differences in cell type counts between COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among CD14+ monocytes and dendritic cells. Additionally, the visual difference in HLA1 expression between the two groups suggests altered antigen presentation.

### Feedback:

1. **Promising Observations:**
   - **Monocyte Abundance:** The higher count of CD14+ monocytes in COVID-19 patients aligns with observations from the referenced paper, suggesting a possible compensatory mechanism or a shift toward a phenotype associated with severe COVID-19.
   - **HLA1 Expression:** The reduced HLA1 expression in COVID-19 could indicate compromised antigen presentation capabilities, consistent with the paper's findings on HLA class II downregulation.

2. **Hypothesis Validation:**
   - While the higher monocyte counts support the hypothesis that monocytes play a significant role in immune reconfiguration during COVID-19, the hypothesized upregulation of inflammatory ligands requires further exploration through differential gene expression analysis.

3. **Further Steps:**
   - **Differential Expression Analysis:** Focus on monocytes to investigate the expression of key inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and corresponding receptors on T cells, to evaluate dysregulated monocyte-T cell communication.
   - **Pathway Analysis:** Conduct enrichment analyses to see if specific immune pathways, particularly those involving cytokine signaling and antigen presentation, are differentially regulated.
   - **Subclustering:** Perform finer subclustering of monocytes and T cells to identify distinct populations potentially contributing to immunopathology.
   - **Correlational Studies:** Explore correlations between HLA1 expression and clinical severity or specific symptoms of COVID-19.

4. **Distinct Analysis Angle:**
   - To distinguish this from the referenced study, consider investigating not only established cell-type roles but also potential new cell types or states emerging under severe COVID-19 conditions through unsupervised clustering.

This feedback should guide future analyses and interpretation of the current dataset while avoiding replication of previously conducted studies.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
CD14 monocytes in severe COVID‐19 patients exhibit dysregulated expression of key inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) compared to healthy controls, potentially driving altered monocyte‐T cell interactions that underlie immunopathology.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the adata object to focus solely on CD14 monocytes.', 'Perform differential expression analysis between COVID and Healthy groups within the CD14 monocytes using a Wilcoxon rank‐sum test to assess expression differences of inflammatory cytokine genes.', 'Visualize the expression patterns of key cytokine markers (TNF, IL1B, IL6) with violin plots for a clear comparison between conditions.', 'Based on the differential expression findings, plan a future analysis to investigate corresponding receptor expression on T cells and potential ligand–receptor connectivity using correlational approaches.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Subset the data to include only CD14 Monocytes
monocyte_subset = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'CD14 Monocyte']

# Verify the distribution of Status in the subset
status_counts = pd.value_counts(monocyte_subset.obs['Status'])
print('CD14 Monocyte counts by Status:', status_counts.to_dict())

# Perform differential expression analysis comparing COVID to Healthy using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(monocyte_subset, groupby='Status', groups=['COVID'], reference='Healthy', method='wilcoxon')

# Extract and print the top genes for COVID group
de_results = monocyte_subset.uns['rank_genes_groups']
groups = de_results['names'].dtype.names
n_top_genes = 5

print('Top DE genes in COVID CD14 Monocytes (vs Healthy):')
for gene in de_results['names'][ 'COVID' ][:n_top_genes]:
    print(gene)

# Visualize key inflammatory cytokines using violin plots
cytokine_genes = ['TNF', 'IL1B', 'IL6']
# Check if these genes are in the dataset
existing_genes = [gene for gene in cytokine_genes if gene in monocyte_subset.var_names]
if existing_genes:
    sc.pl.violin(monocyte_subset, keys=existing_genes, groupby='Status', stripplot=True, jitter=0.4, show=True)
else:
    print('Some of the specified cytokine genes are not present in the dataset.')

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python Code:
• The code is clear and follows the guidelines by subsetting the data to CD14 monocytes using the adata.obs metadata. It effectively prints the counts per Status for quality control.
• The use of sc.tl.rank_genes_groups with a Wilcoxon test is appropriate. However, consider printing not just the top gene names but also their associated p-values or log-fold changes to better support statistical interpretation.
• The check for the existence of cytokine genes before plotting is well implemented. You might also consider adding a warning or log message if none of the key cytokine genes are found.
• Overall, the code is modular and self-contained, and it correctly uses only the allowed packages without re-loading adata.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The analysis plan is focused and aligned with the hypothesis by specifically targeting CD14 monocytes and contrasting COVID‐19 with healthy controls.
• It is methodologically sound—using differential expression analysis and violin plots to assess expression differences in TNF, IL1B, and IL6, while leaving room to explore T cell receptor expression in future analyses to address potential ligand–receptor interactions.
• To enhance novelty and depth, you might consider incorporating additional metadata (e.g., DPS or ventilation status) in subsequent analyses to stratify patients by severity.
• Ensure that all statistical results (e.g., effect sizes and significance) are clearly reported alongside visualizations in later steps.

Both the code and the plan build effectively on previous analyses without repetition, while introducing a novel focus on cytokine dysregulation in CD14 monocytes and their potential impact on monocyte–T cell communication.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results indicate a significant difference in CD14 Monocyte counts between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, with a much higher count in the COVID group. There is also substantial differential expression in CD14 Monocytes with notable genes like IFI27 and CLU showing high log-fold changes. These findings could be important for understanding monocyte-related immune responses in COVID-19.

### Feedback:

1. **Monocyte Counts:**
   - The higher CD14 Monocyte counts in COVID-19 patients align with known immune dysregulation in severe cases. Investigate if this correlates with disease severity or clinical outcomes.

2. **Differential Gene Expression:**
   - The top DE genes such as IFI27, CLU, and IFITM3 are associated with interferon response, suggesting an active antiviral response. Further explore these genes' roles in immune pathways to identify potential therapeutic targets.

3. **Comparison with Prior Work:**
   - Ensure these DE findings differ from those in existing analyses, especially concerning monocyte-driven cytokine responses. Since previous research found little TNF, IL6, or IL1B expression, further validate these results with pathway analyses.

4. **Analyze Ligand-Receptor Interactions:**
   - The original hypothesis highlights monocyte-T cell communication. While cytokine expression does not suggest monocyte-driven cytokine storms, examine if other inflammatory ligands are upregulated. Consider single-cell RNA data to explore receptor expression on T cells (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1).

5. **Future Steps:**
   - **Sub-cluster Analysis:** Refine monocyte sub-clustering to see if distinct subsets exhibit unique DE profiles and correlate with specific immune functions or COVID-19 stages.
   - **Functional Validation:** Use gene set enrichment and pathway analysis on DE genes to confirm biologically relevant pathways, focusing on interferon response and immune regulation.
   - **Integration with Clinical Data:** Correlate gene expression and monocyte counts with clinical metrics such as disease severity and patient outcomes to enhance the translational relevance of findings.

This analysis provides a foundation for deeper exploration of monocyte activity in COVID-19, potentially guiding both research and therapeutic strategies.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Within key immune cell types (CD14 Monocyte and DC), the coordination between antigen presentation (HLA1) and interferon response (IFN1) is modulated by disease status, with COVID‐19 patients showing distinct correlation patterns compared to healthy controls.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the existing CD14 Monocyte and DC data by each disease Status (COVID vs Healthy).', 'For each cell type and group, extract HLA1 and IFN1 expression values from adata.obs and compute the Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value using scipy.stats.pearsonr.', 'Visualize the relationships with scatter plots arranged in a grid layout, overlaying regression lines on each plot and annotating each plot with the computed Pearson correlation statistics.', 'Interpret the differences in correlation patterns between COVID‐19 and Healthy samples to infer potential alterations in immune signaling dynamics.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:

import seaborn as sns
from scipy import stats

# Define cell types and statuses of interest
cell_types_of_interest = ['CD14 Monocyte', 'DC']

Feedback:
Feedback on the Code:
• The code cleanly subsets the adata object for each cell type and disease status, and correctly extracts HLA1 and IFN1 values from adata.obs.
• The use of nested loops to iterate over cell types and statuses with grid-arranged scatter plots is appropriate and aligns with the plan.
• Regression lines are added only when sufficient data points exist (shape > 1), avoiding potential errors.
• Consider adding inline comments regarding the rationale behind key steps (e.g., dropping NaNs, handling low-count groups) to improve clarity.
• The printing of correlation results as a DataFrame correctly facilitates downstream inspection of statistics.
• The plotting aesthetic settings (colors, legend, axis labels) improve interpretability and adhere to the stated visualization guidelines.
  
Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is focused and clearly structured around the core hypothesis of correlating HLA1 and IFN1 expression in CD14 Monocytes and DCs between COVID and Healthy groups.
• Computing Pearson correlation with accompanying p-values is a valid starting point; consider mentioning how you would address potential multiple testing issues if the analysis is later extended.
• The grid layout visualization with overlaid regression lines is effective for comparing groups side by side.
• To further differentiate from previous analyses, you might integrate complementary approaches (e.g., comparing robust correlation measures, or incorporating interaction terms if metadata allows) in later steps.
• Overall, the analysis plan remains tightly focused on the disease-centric hypothesis, ensuring minimal overlap with the original paper and prior attempts.

Both code and plan comply with the specified guidelines and restrict the packages used appropriately.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

================================================================================
RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results show weak correlations between HLA1 and IFN1 expression across different cell types and conditions, with more notable correlations observed in healthy CD14 monocytes. The COVID monocyte correlations are weak and not significant, contrary to expectations from the hypothesis that severe COVID leads to dysregulation in immune communication pathways involving monocytes and T cells.

### Feedback:

1. **Correlation Strength**:
   - The Pearson correlation values are weak across all conditions, suggesting limited linear association between HLA1 and IFN1 expression within these datasets. Only the healthy CD14 monocytes show a moderate correlation, which may indicate some underlying regulatory mechanism in homeostasis. It would be worth exploring this further, potentially distinguishing subsets of healthy individuals to see if any common features drive this correlation.

2. **Biological Interpretation**:
   - The low correlation in COVID-19 samples suggests that the hypothesized dysregulation in ligand-receptor communication might not be driven by HLA1 and IFN1 expression. It suggests that focusing on other genes/proteins involved in monocyte-T cell communication (e.g., TNF-related pathways) might be more fruitful.

3. **Next Steps**:
   - **Broader Gene Analysis**: Extend the analysis to include other inflammatory ligands and receptors (e.g., TNF, IL6, IL1B, and their corresponding receptors) across monocyte and T cell subsets to capture potential dysregulated pathways.
   - **Differential Expression**: Perform differential expression analysis to identify other potential markers that exhibit altered expression profiles specific to COVID-19 status.
   - **Pathway and Network Analysis**: Conduct pathway enrichment and gene network analyses to pinpoint other implicated pathways and interactions specifically in COVID-19 conditions.
   - **Subset Analysis**: Analyze data subsets, possibly distinguishing severity levels within the COVID cohort or conducting time-series analysis if time-course data are available.

4. **Distinct and Meaningful Analysis**:
   - Ensure the analysis remains distinct from what's been reported by focusing on less explored, yet relevant immune cell interactions or regulatory mechanisms predicted by current data trends.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
In severe COVID‐19, the dysregulated cell–cell communication may be mediated not via HLA1/IFN1 but through enhanced inflammatory signaling between monocytes and T cells, where monocytes overexpress inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells upregulate their corresponding receptors (TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R).

Analysis Plan:
["Subset the anndata object to obtain CD14 Monocytes and T cells (using cell_type_coarse labels 'CD14 Monocyte', 'CD4 T', and 'CD8 T').", 'Define inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs to evaluate: (TNF, TNFRSF1A), (IL1B, IL1R1), and (IL6, IL6R).', "For each condition (COVID and Healthy), group cells by donor (using the 'Donor_full' metadata) and compute average expression levels of the ligand in monocytes and the corresponding receptor in T cells.", 'Ensure that only donors with a sufficient number of cells in both monocyte and T cell subsets are considered for each condition.', 'For each ligand–receptor pair and each condition, calculate the Pearson correlation between the donor-level average ligand expression and receptor expression.', 'Visualize the results in a grid of scatter plots (rows corresponding to ligand–receptor pairs and columns to disease statuses) with regression lines and annotated correlation statistics.']

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python Code for the First Step:
• The code correctly subsets CD14 Monocytes and T cells, checks that the required ligand and receptor genes are present, and uses donor-level averaging prior to correlation testing. This shows good data integrity control.
• Converting sparse matrices to arrays (with toarray()) for downstream operations is well handled and ensures compatibility with NumPy and Pandas.
• The grid layout for plotting scatter plots by disease status and ligand–receptor pair is well organized, and the inclusion of regression lines with annotation is a useful visualization aid.
• It would be beneficial to add a configurable threshold for the minimum number of donors required before performing correlation analyses to avoid spurious results.
• Consider modularizing repeating processes (e.g., the donor-level averaging for ligands and receptors) into functions for clarity and reusability, especially if you plan to extend the analysis.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The hypothesis is clearly defined and the plan is innovative by shifting focus to inflammatory ligand–receptor interactions between monocytes and T cells rather than the commonly analyzed HLA1/IFN1 pair.
• The design to compute correlation on donor-level averages for each condition is solid—it minimizes biases from single-cell variability while leveraging available metadata.
• The stepwise structure ensures that only donors with sufficient cell counts are considered, maintaining statistical rigor.
• The visualization strategy using a grid of scatter plots with regression fits is appropriate to communicate the observed relationships.
• Overall, the plan builds on existing work but remains distinct by focusing on a novel intercellular communication axis; it fulfills the guidelines of minimal overlap with previous analyses.

Overall, both the code and analysis plan are well thought-out and implemented in adherence to the specified guidelines, with only minor suggestions for increasing modularity and explicit handling of low donor counts.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results indicate varying degrees of correlation between cytokine expression in monocytes and their corresponding receptor expression in T cells in both COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Here's an analysis of the findings:

1. **TNF and TNFRSF1A:**
   - **COVID:** Negative correlation (-0.37) suggests that increased TNF expression in monocytes might not enhance receptor expression in T cells. 
   - **Healthy:** Virtually no correlation (0.09), indicating no strong relationship.

2. **IL1B and IL1R1:**
   - **COVID:** Moderate negative correlation (-0.23) and high p-value signify no significant relationship, opposing the hypothesis of increased receptor-ligand signaling.
   - **Healthy:** Similar weak correlation (-0.07).

3. **IL6 and IL6R:**
   - **COVID:** Moderate positive correlation (0.46) implies potential enhanced communication, although the p-value (0.25) does not support significance.
   - **Healthy:** Negative correlation (-0.33).

**Feedback and Suggestions:**

- **Focus on IL6/IL6R:** The moderate positive correlation in COVID patients, although not statistically significant, might suggest a trend worth further investigation. Increasing sample size or using more powerful statistical methods might reveal significant patterns.

- **Explore Alternative Pathways:** Given the negative correlations and non-significant results, consider investigating additional cytokines or pathways that might be involved in immune dysregulation.

- **Refine the Analysis Strategy:** Further stratification by severity of disease (e.g., ARDS vs. non-ARDS cases) might unveil more detailed insights.

- **Contextual Interpretation:** Align findings with existing literature or parallel experiments to interpret biological significance more clearly.

- **Iterate with Additional Metrics:** Explore temporal changes or cell-type-specific responses to improve understanding of immune communication in COVID-19.

These findings can guide future steps in refining the hypothesis or methodological approach, ensuring results are both novel and meaningful.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Within COVID‐19 patients, especially those under ventilation (severe cases), the coordination between IL6 expression in CD14 Monocytes and IL6R expression in T cells is altered compared to non‐ventilated patients, reflecting potentially dysregulated cell–cell communication in the most severe forms of the disease.

Analysis Plan:
["Subset the dataset to retain only COVID samples and further split these into 'Vent' (ventilated) and 'NonVent' groups based on the 'Ventilated' metadata.", 'Within each ventilation subgroup, subset CD14 Monocytes (ligand producers for IL6) and T cells (receptor expressers for IL6R).', 'For each subgroup, compute donor-level average expression for IL6 (from monocytes) and IL6R (from T cells), ensuring that donor overlap is maintained.', 'Calculate Pearson correlation coefficients between average IL6 and IL6R expression for each ventilation subgroup, only if the number of donors meets a set threshold.', 'Visualize the results in a grid layout showing scatter plots with regression lines, and annotate the plots with the correlation statistics.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python Code for Step 1:
• The code cleanly implements the subsetting of COVID‐19 samples and further splits them by ventilation status as required by the analysis hypothesis.
• Using the helper function compute_donor_average is a good design choice; it abstracts donor‐level averaging, and the check for sparse matrices (toarray) is properly handled.
• The method to identify common donors (using set intersection) is correct, but ensure that the ordering (via sorted and later using .loc[common_donors]) matches the indices in the computed donor averages; any donor ID mismatches could lead to dropped data.
• The scatterplot with an overlaid regression line is well executed. Consider adding more descriptive axis labels or annotations (e.g., rounding correlation values) to further improve clarity.
• The code adheres to the package restrictions, uses inline comments appropriately, and generates a grid of visuals as specified.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The overall plan is well-focused on distinguishing ventilation groups (Vent vs NonVent) and examines the coordination between IL6 expression in CD14 Monocytes and IL6R in T cells, which is distinct from the previous analyses.
• The donor‐level averaging ensures that the analysis accounts for between‐donor variability; this is important for reducing noise and achieving robust correlations.
• The plan logically builds on the hypothesis and details specific steps including thresholding for donor inclusion and producing annotated scatter plots.
• The approach is novel relative to the paper’s previous computational analyses and the earlier attempts, emphasizing a cell–cell communication axis using specific ligand–receptor interplay.
• One potential improvement is to outline how potential confounders (e.g., differences in donor sample size or batch effects) will be accounted for, even if exploratory, to further strengthen the analysis.

Overall, both the code and analysis plan are thorough, reproducible, and adhere to the guidelines provided.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

PROMPT: Results Interpretation (user)

Donor-level average expression correlation results (IL6/IL6R by Ventilation Status):
               Vent   NonVent
pearson_r  0.725206 -0.223625
p_value    0.274794  0.776375
n_donors   4.000000  4.000000



================================================================================
2025-05-17 15:37:37,003 - INFO
================================================================================
RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results show differing correlations between IL6 and IL6R expression in CD14 monocytes and T cells based on ventilation status. For ventilated patients, there is a positive correlation (r = 0.73), whereas for non-ventilated patients, the correlation is negative (r = -0.22). However, the p-values for both groups are not significant (p > 0.05), indicating that the results are not statistically robust.

**Feedback:**

1. **Sample Size**: The small sample size (n = 4 for each group) limits statistical power and may contribute to the non-significant p-values. Increasing the sample size could help obtain more reliable results.

2. **Biological Insights**: The higher correlation in ventilated patients might suggest altered monocyte-T cell communication in more severe cases, aligning with your hypothesis about enhanced inflammatory signaling in these patients. However, given the lack of statistical significance, additional validation is needed.

3. **Future Steps**:
   - **Increase Sample Size**: Consider incorporating more donors to improve the robustness of the findings.
   - **Contextual Analyses**: Explore other ligand-receptor pairs to identify consistent patterns across different inflammatory pathways.
   - **Functional Assays**: Validate findings with functional assays that examine the actual interaction and signaling pathways in vitro, if possible.
   - **Longitudinal Analysis**: If available, assess changes over time within the same patients to determine dynamic changes in immune communication throughout the disease course.

4. **Distinguishing From Existing Research**: Focus on novel pathways or underexplored cell interactions, such as unconventional T cell subsets interacting with monocytes, to offer unique insights beyond what has been characterized in the literature.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Beyond differential co‐expression, the absolute expression levels of antigen presentation (HLA1) and interferon response (IFN1) genes in CD14 Monocytes and DC may be dysregulated in COVID‐19 compared to healthy individuals, indicating altered immune states in severe disease.

Analysis Plan:
['For each selected cell type (CD14 Monocyte and DC), subset the cells from the in-memory adata object.', 'Stratify these cells by disease status (COVID vs Healthy) and extract the expression values of HLA1 and IFN1 directly from the metadata.', 'Perform non‐parametric Mann–Whitney U tests to statistically compare the expression distributions of HLA1 and IFN1 between COVID and Healthy samples in each cell type.', 'Visualize the expression patterns using violin plots (with overlaid boxplots) to qualitatively assess distribution differences across the two conditions.']

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan Feedback:
 – The plan is clear and focused on testing dysregulation of HLA1 and IFN1 expression in CD14 Monocytes and DC between COVID and Healthy groups, which is novel relative to previous analyses.
 – The use of a non‐parametric Mann–Whitney U test and violin plus boxplot visualizations is appropriate; consider noting potential need for multiple testing corrections if extending the analysis.
 – Ensure that the metadata (from adata.obs) reliably reflects absolute expression levels, as these are often normalized measures, and provide justification if these numeric values are in the expected scale for comparison.
 – Overall, the plan targets a specific hypothesis and leverages available metadata, aligning well with prior steps while extending the analysis in a novel direction.

• Code Feedback:
 – The code adheres to the guidelines by subsetting the in‑memory “adata” and using only the permitted packages.
 – The subsetting by ‘cell_type_coarse’ and ‘Status’ is implemented correctly, and the extraction of gene expression from adata.obs is efficient.
 – Using a grid of subplots for visualization is excellent; consider adding a check or comment regarding cells with low counts in one group to preempt potential warnings from the Mann–Whitney U test.
 – Consider including inline comments on why Mann–Whitney U was chosen over other tests to enhance clarity.
 – The print statement displaying the results as a DataFrame is helpful, but you might also consider labeling the output for clarity.
 – The use of .dropna() ensures that missing values are handled; however, ensure that the threshold for 'sufficient data' (implicitly any non-zero count) is robust for your hypothesis.
 – Code style is clear, modular, and builds on previous analyses without duplication.

Overall, both the analysis plan and first-step code are well constructed, adhere to standards, and provide a good basis for subsequent, more in-depth analyses.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The Mann-Whitney U test results indicate significant differences in the expression of HLA1 and IFN1 between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in CD14 monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs). Here’s some feedback for future analysis steps:

1. **Evaluate Biological Significance:**
   - The downregulation of HLA1 in COVID-19 patients, particularly in monocytes and DCs, suggests compromised antigen presentation, aligning with findings of impaired HLA class II expression in severe cases.
   - IFN1 upregulation in COVID-19 samples implies an active interferon response, which may have both protective and pathological roles. Exploring the context of this expression (e.g., patient outcomes) could provide insights into its effects.

2. **Extend Analysis to Other Cell Types:**
   - Analyze other immune cells (e.g., T cells, NK cells) for expression of inflammatory ligands and receptors. These results will complement understanding of cell-cell communication changes during severe COVID-19.

3. **Integrate with Pathway Analysis:**
   - Perform pathway enrichment analyses on differentially expressed genes to uncover affected pathways, emphasizing those involved in immune modulation and cytokine signaling.

4. **Correlation with Clinical Data:**
   - Relate expression changes to clinical parameters such as disease severity, ARDS development, or treatment history. This correlation can help identify potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets.

5. **Use RNA Velocity and Trajectory Inference:**
   - Utilize RNA velocity to infer cell state transitions, focusing on immune cell differentiation dynamics. This approach may help elucidate how immune responses evolve in severe disease.

6. **Consider Cell-Cell Interaction Models:**
   - Employ computational models to investigate ligand-receptor interactions, providing a deeper understanding of immune cell communication within the disease context.

These steps can help clarify the immune landscape in severe COVID-19, potentially validating the hypothesis about dysregulated cell-cell communication contributing to immunopathology.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
In COVID‐19 patients, T cells may undergo an altered activation trajectory that is characterized by a progressive increase in IFN1 expression, which could reflect dysregulated interferon-mediated signaling and contribute to disease pathogenesis.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the dataset to extract T cells (CD4 T and CD8 T) from adata.', 'Preprocess the T cell subset by performing PCA and constructing a neighborhood graph to obtain a low-dimensional embedding.', 'Apply diffusion pseudotime (DPT) analysis using the cell with the lowest IFN1 expression as the root to model the transition in T cell activation states.', 'Visualize UMAP embeddings colored by diffusion pseudotime, IFN1 expression, and disease Status (COVID vs Healthy) to assess and compare the trajectories.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Subset T cells: include both CD4 and CD8 T cells
tcell_subset = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'].isin(['CD4 T', 'CD8 T'])].copy()

# Optional: scale the data to limit extreme values
sc.pp.scale(tcell_subset, max_value=10)

# Perform PCA for dimensionality reduction
sc.tl.pca(tcell_subset, svd_solver='arpack')

# Compute the neighborhood graph based on PCA results
sc.pp.neighbors(tcell_subset, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30)

# Compute a UMAP embedding for visualization
sc.tl.umap(tcell_subset)

# Identify the root cell for DPT: choose the cell with the lowest IFN1 expression as a proxy for a less-activated state
root_cell = tcell_subset.obs['IFN1'].idxmin()

# Run diffusion pseudotime analysis with the identified root cell
sc.tl.dpt(tcell_subset, root_key=root_cell)

# Visualize the UMAP embedding colored by diffusion pseudotime, IFN1 expression, and clinical Status
sc.pl.umap(tcell_subset, color=['dpt_pseudotime', 'IFN1', 'Status'], wspace=0.4, show=True)

Feedback:
Feedback on the First Step Code:
1. The code cleanly subsets CD4 and CD8 T cells and follows a clear pipeline (scaling, PCA, neighbors, UMAP) before applying DPT. The inclusion of copying the subset and scaling with a maximum value helps control for outliers.
2. The selection of the root cell using the lowest IFN1 expression is logical given the hypothesis; however, it might be beneficial to add a brief check (or comment) ensuring that the IFN1 distribution in T cells is appropriate for defining a “naïve” or less-activated state.
3. Ensure that the use of the "root_key" parameter in sc.tl.dpt is compatible with your Scanpy version—typically a “root” cell (or index) can be specified; confirm that your approach to choosing the cell by idxmin() is supported.
4. Overall, the code adheres to the package usage guidelines and maintains clarity. Minor inline comments detailing choice of parameters (e.g., why 15 neighbors or 30 PCs) could provide additional clarity, especially for reproducibility.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
1. The plan focuses on a novel aspect: modeling T cell activation trajectory via diffusion pseudotime using IFN1 as a marker. This approach is distinct from previous analyses and the paper’s methodology, satisfying the criteria for novelty.
2. While the plan is well structured, consider integrating additional statistical tests (for example, correlating pseudotime with IFN1 expression gradients or comparing distributions between COVID and healthy groups) to confirm the trend quantitatively.
3. Because the hypothesis emphasizes altered activation states in COVID‐19, you might also benefit from comparing trajectories between CD4 and CD8 T cells separately if differences are expected.
4. Although the planned visualization (UMAP colored by pseudotime, IFN1, and Status) is strong, consider including summary plots such as violin plots or line plots that depict IFN1 progression along pseudotime to reinforce your findings.
5. Overall, the plan remains tightly focused on the hypothesized trajectory and leverages the available metadata effectively.

These enhancements should solidify both the code and the analysis strategy while maintaining your focus on a novel transcriptomic trajectory analysis in COVID‐19 T cells.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps. 

You are given the following summary of the anndata object:
Below is a description of the columns in adata.obs: 
Column Admission contains the values ['Floor' 'ICU' 'N/A'] 
Column ClusterID contains the values ['1' '10' '11' '12' '13' '14' '15' '16' '17' '18']

Here are the previous analyses attempted:
In severe COVID‐19 patients, key immune cells (particularly CD14 Monocytes and dendritic cells) exhibit stronger coordination between antigen presentation (HLA1) and interferon response (IFN1) compared to healthy controls, suggesting dysregulated immune signaling that could contribute to disease severity.


Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
The paper focuses on severe COVID-19, a condition induced by SARS‑CoV‑2 infection that, in a subset of patients, progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.

Biological background  
Key biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.

Paper’s computational analyses  
A series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: In severe COVID-19, prolonged disease duration (reflected by higher DPS values) is associated with increased mitochondrial stress in adaptive immune cells (specifically CD4 T and CD8 T cells), suggesting that extended immune activation leads to metabolic dysregulation.

Analysis Plan:
1. Filter the dataset to include only COVID-19 patients and then further subset the data to two adaptive immune cell types, CD4 T and CD8 T cells.
2. Perform an exploratory analysis to inspect the distribution of days post symptom onset (DPS) and mitochondrial gene percentages (percent_mt) in these cell types, ensuring sufficient data coverage.
3. Generate scatter plots for each cell type displaying DPS versus percent_mt and overlay linear regression lines to visualize potential trends.
4. Use Spearman or Pearson correlation followed by linear regression analysis (via scipy.stats.linregress) for each cell type to statistically assess the relationship between DPS and mitochondrial stress, printing regression coefficients and p-values.
5. Combine the plots into a grid layout using matplotlib or seaborn to compare patterns between CD4 T and CD8 T cells, and summarize the findings regarding metabolic dysregulation in relation to disease duration.

Initial Code:
import scanpy as sc
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# First step: Filter for COVID-19 patients and further subset for CD4 T and CD8 T cells
# Assume adata is already loaded in memory

# Filter cells with Status 'COVID'
covid_cells = adata[adata.obs['Status'] == 'COVID']

# Further subset these cells based on cell type (coarse annotation) for CD4 T and CD8 T cells
cd4_cells = covid_cells[covid_cells.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'CD4 T']
cd8_cells = covid_cells[covid_cells.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'CD8 T']

# Print number of cells in each subset as a sanity check
print('Number of CD4 T cells in COVID patients:', cd4_cells.n_obs)
print('Number of CD8 T cells in COVID patients:', cd8_cells.n_obs)

# Quick exploratory visualization of DPS distribution and percent_mt for CD4 T cells

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
In severe COVID-19, prolonged disease duration (reflected by higher DPS values) is associated with increased mitochondrial stress in adaptive immune cells (specifically CD4 T and CD8 T cells), suggesting that extended immune activation leads to metabolic dysregulation.

Analysis Plan:
['Filter the dataset to include only COVID-19 patients and then further subset the data to two adaptive immune cell types, CD4 T and CD8 T cells.', 'Perform an exploratory analysis to inspect the distribution of days post symptom onset (DPS) and mitochondrial gene percentages (percent_mt) in these cell types, ensuring sufficient data coverage.', 'Generate scatter plots for each cell type displaying DPS versus percent_mt and overlay linear regression lines to visualize potential trends.', 'Use Spearman or Pearson correlation followed by linear regression analysis (via scipy.stats.linregress) for each cell type to statistically assess the relationship between DPS and mitochondrial stress, printing regression coefficients and p-values.', 'Combine the plots into a grid layout using matplotlib or seaborn to compare patterns between CD4 T and CD8 T cells, and summarize the findings regarding metabolic dysregulation in relation to disease duration.']

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python Code:
• The filtering steps correctly isolate COVID cells and then subset for both CD4 T and CD8 T cells. It follows the guidelines of using only the provided metadata.
• The sanity-check print statements are useful to ensure adequate cell counts.
• The exploratory scatter plot for CD4 T cells is clear, but ensure that similar exploratory visualization is done for CD8 T cells in subsequent steps.
• Consider adding error checking for existence of columns ('DPS', 'percent_mt', etc.) in adata.obs to improve robustness.
• The code is concise and does not repeat previous analysis steps.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is well-focused on testing the novel hypothesis by targeting adaptive immune cells (CD4 and CD8 T cells) and linking DPS with mitochondrial stress.
• The plan appropriately starts with filtering and then moves to exploratory analysis, visualization, and statistical testing – aligning with the available metadata.
• The use of both correlation tests (Spearman/Pearson) and linear regression via scipy.stats.linregress is suitable. Ensure that assumptions for these tests are evaluated (e.g., linearity, distribution) or consider including a brief rationale for the test choice.
• As the analysis aims for a novel perspective compared to previous attempts and literature, the clear focus on mitochondrial stress in relation to prolonged immune activation is a strength.
• In future steps, ensure that comparisons between CD4 and CD8 T cells are clearly delineated (possibly in a grid layout) to highlight any differential trends.
• Incorporate discussion of potential confounding factors, if any relevant metadata (e.g., age, sex, or other sample characteristics) is available, even if only as a note for further validation.
• Overall, the plan is self-contained and leverages only the allowed packages and the provided anndata object.

Both the code and analysis plan build well on past analyses while introducing a distinct and novel aspect to understand adaptive immune cell dysregulation in severe COVID-19.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: In severe COVID-19, prolonged disease duration (reflected by higher DPS values) is associated with increased mitochondrial stress in adaptive immune cells (specifically CD4 T and CD8 T cells), suggesting that extended immune activation leads to metabolic dysregulation.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Verify that the necessary metadata columns (e.g., 'Status', 'cell_type_coarse', 'DPS', 'percent_mt') exist, then filter the dataset to include only COVID-19 patients and subset the adaptive immune cells (CD4 T and CD8 T cells).
2. Perform an exploratory analysis to inspect the distribution of days post symptom onset (DPS) and mitochondrial gene percentages (percent_mt) in these cell types, ensuring sufficient data coverage.
3. Generate scatter plots for each cell type displaying DPS versus percent_mt with distinct colors and overlay linear regression lines to visualize potential trends.
4. Conduct correlation tests (Spearman/Pearson) and linear regression analysis (using scipy.stats.linregress) for each cell type to statistically assess the relationship between DPS and mitochondrial stress, printing regression coefficients and p-values while evaluating test assumptions.
5. Combine the plots into a grid layout using matplotlib or seaborn to compare patterns between CD4 T and CD8 T cells, and summarize the findings regarding metabolic dysregulation in relation to disease duration.

Revised Code:
import scanpy as sc
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Check that necessary metadata columns exist
required_columns = ['Status', 'cell_type_coarse', 'DPS', 'percent_mt']

    raise KeyError(f"Missing required metadata columns in adata.obs: {missing_columns}")

# Filter cells with Status 'COVID'
covid_cells = adata[adata.obs['Status'] == 'COVID']

# Further subset these cells based on cell type (using coarse annotation) for CD4 T and CD8 T cells
cd4_cells = covid_cells[covid_cells.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'CD4 T']
cd8_cells = covid_cells[covid_cells.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'CD8 T']

# Sanity check: count the number of cells in each subset

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current analysis provides a basic characterization of CD4 and CD8 T cell populations in COVID patients. To enhance the study's biological significance and distinctiveness from the research paper, consider the following:

1. **Promising Observations:**
   - The observed numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells provide a foundation for further exploration. Given the suspected role of T cells in COVID-19 pathology, these data could be pivotal in understanding immune responses.

2. **Explore T Cell Subtypes:**
   - Further sub-clustering of CD4 and CD8 T cells could identify functional subpopulations (e.g., effector vs. regulatory T cells) that may be differentially regulated in COVID-19.

3. **Phenotypic Analysis:**
   - Investigate expression levels of inflammatory cytokine receptors on T cells, as implicated in the hypothesis regarding monocyte-T cell interactions. Exploring specific receptor-ligand pairs could indicate potential signaling pathways contributing to immunopathology.

4. **Temporal Dynamics:**
   - The plot showing mitochondrial content versus days post-symptom onset (DPS) could indicate changes in cell activation or stress. Consider correlating gene expression or phenotype changes over time.

5. **Contrast with Healthy Controls:**
   - Comparing these T cell metrics directly with healthy controls will clarify COVID-19 specific alterations and support or refute hypotheses pertaining to enhanced immune cell communication.

6. **Iterate on Immune Communication Hypothesis:**
   - Employ network analysis or ligand-receptor interaction prediction tools to explore hypothesized communication enhancement between monocytes and T cells.

7. **Differential Gene Expression:**
   - Conduct DE analysis between COVID-19 patients and controls focusing on genes involved in inflammatory responses and T cell signaling to validate the communication hypothesis.

8. **Biological Function and Pathway Analysis:**
   - Perform pathway enrichment analyses on DE genes to identify dysregulated biological processes, supporting insights into potential mechanisms of disease severity.

By addressing these suggestions, subsequent steps in your analysis will provide a more comprehensive picture of immune alterations in severe COVID-19 and help validate or refine current hypotheses.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
The temporal dynamics of mitochondrial content in T cells correlates with disease progression in COVID-19, and these trends may differ between CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as between COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset T cells (CD4 and CD8) from both COVID-19 and healthy samples to allow direct comparisons.', 'Generate histograms with KDE overlays to inspect the distributions of DPS and percent_mt for each T cell subtype and condition.', 'Create scatter plots with regression overlays for COVID-19 T cells to visualize the relationship between DPS and percent_mt.', 'Perform Spearman correlation tests for CD4 and CD8 T cells in COVID-19 samples to statistically assess the association between DPS and mitochondrial stress.', 'Prepare to expand the analysis based on these trends, such as exploring T cell sub-clusters or additional phenotypic markers.']

Feedback:
Feedback on Analysis Plan:
• The plan is well-focused on the specified hypothesis and clearly outlines the necessary steps—subsetting T cells, visualizing DPS and mitochondrial content distributions, exploring correlations with scatter plots, and performing statistical tests.
• The use of separate analyses for CD4 and CD8 T cells between COVID‐19 and healthy samples is appropriate and novel in the context of previous efforts.
• Consider adding a step to validate data quality (e.g., verifying the range or distribution of DPS and percent_mt across subsets) to ensure reliable downstream analyses.
• Ensure that “regression overlays” mentioned in the plan are later implemented, as the current step only covers scatter plotting and correlation.

Feedback on the First Step Python Code:
• The code correctly subsets CD4 and CD8 T cells from both COVID-19 and healthy samples using clear indexing with adata.obs values.
• The use of a 2×2 grid for visualizations is well thought out; however, note that regression overlays (as proposed in the plan) are not incorporated yet—incorporate a regression line (e.g., using seaborn’s regplot or lmplot) in future iterations.
• The histograms for DPS and percent_mt for CD4 T cells are clearly labeled and use distinct colors and transparencies to differentiate COVID and healthy samples.
• Spearman correlation is appropriately calculated and annotated on the scatter plots for both CD4 and CD8 COVID T cells, aligning with the hypothesis testing.
• The code adheres to the package restrictions and keeps the analysis self-contained, loading metadata exclusively from the in-memory anndata object.
• Minor improvements could include:
  – Consistent labeling of axes (consider including units if applicable).
  – Ensuring that bin sizes in histograms are optimized for the data distribution.
  – Optionally, adding error handling if columns like ‘DPS’ or ‘percent_mt’ contain missing values.
Overall, both the analysis plan and the code are solid and aligned with the novel hypothesis while remaining distinct from previous work.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

Here is the code from the last 3 steps. Make sure the modified code builds on the past analyses and doesn't repeat any of them:

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current analysis provides important insights into the distribution of "Days Post Symptom Onset" (DPS) for CD4 and CD8 T cells in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Here are some key points for future steps:

### Promising Results:
1. **DPS Variability in COVID-19:** The wide distribution of DPS in COVID-19 patients compared to the constant value (0) in healthy controls indicates a range of immune responses over time in patients. This warrants further investigation to identify potential factors contributing to this variability.

2. **Mitochondrial Content Analysis:** The generally lower mean and median percent of mitochondrial content in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals could be associated with altered metabolic states or cellular stress responses in infection. It's worth exploring the biological implications of these differences.

### Future Steps:
1. **Cell Communication Analysis:**
   - Explore cell-cell interactions specifically between monocytes and T cells using ligand-receptor analysis to validate the hypothesis of enhanced communication pathways contributing to immunopathology.
   - Investigate the expression of inflammatory ligands and corresponding receptors to confirm if there is indeed upregulation in COVID-19 patients.

2. **Dynamics and Trajectory Analysis:**
   - Perform trajectory or pseudotime analysis to explore the progression and transition states of these T cells over time in symptomatic patients, potentially linking the DPS with certain expression patterns or phenotypes.

3. **Functional Analysis:**
   - Conduct functional enrichment analysis to identify pathways or transcriptional programs that are specifically active in these different DPS phases in COVID-19 patients. This could help correlate symptom progression with underlying biological mechanisms.

4. **Integrate Additional Variables:**
   - Integrate other clinical metadata (e.g., ventilation status, treatment) to correlate DPS with disease severity metrics or treatment effects, providing a more comprehensive view of the immune response landscape.

5. **Longitudinal Follow-Up:**
   - Consider longitudinal data collection (if possible) to monitor how these immune profiles evolve in individual patients over time, which might provide insights into recovery or progression to severe disease.

These steps should help deepen the understanding of immune dynamics in severe COVID-19, contributing to the broader research objectives while maintaining a unique analysis approach.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Pseudotemporal ordering of CD4 and CD8 T cells in COVID-19 patients will reveal a continuous trajectory that correlates with increasing Days Post Symptom Onset (DPS) and altered mitochondrial content, suggesting that immune activation dynamics drive metabolic shifts during disease progression.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset COVID-19 CD4 and CD8 T cells from the adata object.', 'For each subset, calculate PCA, construct a k-nearest neighbor graph, and compute diffusion pseudotime (DPT) using the cell with the lowest DPS as the root.', 'Assess the correlation between the computed pseudotime and both DPS and percent_mt by plotting scatter plots and overlaying regression lines.', 'Display the plots in a grid layout to compare trajectories between CD4 and CD8 T cells.']

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan Feedback:
 – The plan clearly focuses on pseudotime analysis for COVID‐19 CD4 and CD8 T cells and is distinct from previous analyses. It appropriately proposes correlating pseudotime with DPS and mitochondrial content.
 – Consider adding a preliminary data quality check and ensuring that DPS values are robust before using them to define the root for pseudotime.
 – The plan could further benefit from overlaying regression lines on the scatter plots to visually support the statistical tests.

• Code Feedback:
 – The subsetting of COVID‐19 T cells by status and cell type is correctly implemented.
 – In the compute_dpt function, converting the DPS column to numeric is good; however, it would be prudent to check for missing or NaN values before computing the minimum.
 – The selection of the root cell using the minimum DPS is a reasonable strategy, but verify that the chosen Scanpy version accepts a cell index as the “root_key.” In some versions, sc.tl.dpt expects a parameter named “root” (or the root cell to be pre-assigned in adata.obs); please double‐check the API documentation.
 – The PCA and neighbor graph computations are correctly chained before calling DPT.
 – When plotting, the scoring and correlation calculations are appropriately performed. However, as noted in the plan, overlaying regression lines (for example using sns.regplot or lmplot) would further strengthen the visualization.
 – Code styling and modularization follow the guidelines and are clear and replicable.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results presented provide diffusion pseudotime (DPT) analyses for CD4 and CD8 T cells in relation to days post-symptom onset (DPS) and mitochondrial percentage (percent_mt). Here are some insights and suggestions for further exploration:

### Insights

1. **Negative Correlation with DPS**: Both CD4 and CD8 T cells show a slight negative correlation between DPT and DPS, indicating that pseudotime progresses as the disease timeline increases, potentially reflecting changes in cell states over time.

2. **Negative Correlation with Mitochondrial Percentage**: There is also a negative correlation between DPT and mitochondrial percentage, which might suggest metabolic alterations or stress responses as cells transition through pseudotime.

3. **Statistical Significance**: All correlations are statistically significant, suggesting these trends are worth further investigation.

### Recommendations for Future Steps

1. **Further Analysis of T Cell Subsets**: Investigate specific gene expression changes along the pseudotime trajectory for both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Focus on genes involved in immune signaling and cell communication, which might relate to the hypothesis of altered T cell interactions in severe COVID-19.

2. **Integration with Cell-Cell Communication**: Since the hypothesis revolves around enhanced communication between monocytes and T cells, consider how pseudotime dynamics relate to ligand-receptor interactions. Utilize tools like CellPhoneDB or NicheNet to predict potential communication pathways.

3. **Cross-validate with Other Cell Types**: Perform similar pseudotime analyses on monocytes or other relevant immune cells to understand how these transitions compare and whether common pathways or timelines are involved.

4. **Functionality and Metabolic Pathway Analysis**: Examine the role of oxidative stress and mitochondrial function in relation to pseudotime. This may reveal connections between metabolic shifts and immune function during disease progression.

5. **Comparison with Healthy Controls**: If not already performed, comparing these trajectories with those from healthy controls could provide insight into COVID-19 specific alterations.

6. **Time-Series Expression Analysis**: Analyze dynamic changes at the gene set level across pseudotime to identify pathways enriched at different stages, which might highlight the biological processes underlying these correlations.

These follow-up analyses could help validate the hypothesis related to immune cell communication and uncover potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for severe COVID-19.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
The expression levels of key immune signaling and cell communication genes in CD4 and CD8 T cells vary along the diffusion pseudotime trajectory, suggesting that dynamic transcriptional changes underlie functional shifts in immune responses during severe COVID-19.

Analysis Plan:
['Define a candidate set of immune signaling genes that are relevant for T cell activation and communication.', 'Extract and verify the expression values of these candidate genes from the pseudotime-analyzed CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets.', 'Bin cells along the diffusion pseudotime trajectory into several intervals and compute the mean pseudotime and mean gene expression in each bin.', 'Plot smoothed expression dynamics (line plots) for each candidate gene against mean pseudotime for both CD4 and CD8 T cells.', 'Perform Spearman correlation tests between individual gene expression levels and pseudotime to statistically assess dynamic trends.']

Feedback:
Analysis Plan Feedback:
• The hypothesis is clearly defined and your plan focuses on dynamic changes in immune signaling genes along pseudotime in T cells, which is distinct from prior analyses.  
• Focusing on key candidate genes and visualizing their smoothed expression dynamics in binned pseudotime adds a novel temporal dimension contrast to earlier static comparisons.  
• Including Spearman correlation tests to support statistical significance is appropriate. Consider whether additional smoothing methods (e.g., LOESS) could further reveal trends.  
• Ensure that candidate gene selection and binning do not inadvertently exclude rare but important expression patterns.

Code Feedback:
• The code correctly subsets candidate genes based on availability in the AnnData objects and converts sparse matrices to dense format safely.  
• Using pd.cut for binning is straightforward; however, be cautious if the pseudotime distribution is skewed—the bins may contain highly uneven cell counts. Consider checking bin sizes before aggregation.  
• When generating subplots, the grid dimensions are determined by the maximum number of candidate genes between CD4 and CD8 cells. This may result in empty subplots for one group if the lengths differ. Adding a check or iterating over each cell type separately could improve clarity.  
• The layout and plotting code is well organized, but incorporating error handling for cases where no candidate genes are found in one cell type could enhance robustness.  
• Overall, the script adheres to the guidelines and builds on previous analyses without repetition while making a novel contribution.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results from the Spearman correlation analysis for CD4 and CD8 T cells show relatively modest correlation coefficients (rho values around 0.1 to 0.18) but highly significant p-values, indicating statistically significant correlations with gene expression. However, these correlations are weak, suggesting limited biological relevance individually. Nonetheless, the data allows focus on certain genes for potential follow-up:

### Promising Observations:
1. **IL2RG and IL7R** in both CD4 and CD8 T cells show relatively higher correlation values. These genes are involved in T cell survival and proliferation, suggesting a potential role in immune responses during COVID-19.
2. **TNFRSF1A** gene shows a modest but significant correlation. This receptor is known to mediate TNF-induced signaling pathways, which could be relevant to inflammation in severe COVID-19.
3. **Pseudotime Analysis** indicates dynamic expression changes over time, particularly for key immune-related genes. For example, changes in CD3D, IL2RG, and TNFRSF1A could be related to disease progression or immune response phases.

### Future Steps:
1. **Pathway Analysis**: Focus on genes with modest but significant correlations and their biological pathways. IL2RG and IL7R, being related to survival and proliferation, might be involved in broader immune activation pathways. Use pathway enrichment analyses to explore these in-depth.
2. **Comparative Study**: Compare gene expression and pseudotime dynamics between COVID-19 patients with different severity levels. This could highlight how gene expression changes correlate with disease progression.
3. **Cell-Cell Communication Analyses**: Investigate interactions specifically between monocytes and T cell subsets focusing on receptors and ligands identified, like those involving TNFRSF1A. This aligns with and could validate the initial hypothesis about monocyte-T cell signaling dysregulation.
4. **Integration with Previous Findings**: Cross-reference these findings with previous analyses of monocyte HLA Class II downregulation and ISG expression, to assess the impact on T cell function and signaling.

These analyses could help validate the hypothesis on dysregulated communication pathways in severe COVID-19 and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Prolonged immune activation in severe COVID-19 leads not only to mitochondrial stress but also to altered IL2/IL7 signaling in T cells. This may be reflected by changes in the coordinated expression of key receptors and co-stimulatory molecules along disease progression.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset COVID-19 T cells into CD4 and CD8 populations from the in‐memory adata.', 'Define an IL2/IL7 signaling pathway gene signature using receptors and T cell markers (e.g. IL2RG, IL7R, CD3D, CD3E) and restrict the list to genes present in the dataset.', 'Compute gene signature scores for each T cell using sc.tl.score_genes to quantify pathway activity, storing the scores in a new observation column.', 'Assess the relationship between the IL2/IL7 pathway score and days post symptom onset (DPS) by calculating Spearman correlations in each cell type.', 'Visualize the association via scatter plots with regression lines and annotate the plots with the correlation coefficients and p-values.']

Feedback:
Feedback on the First Step Python Code:
• The subsetting of COVID‐19 T cells into CD4 and CD8 populations is implemented clearly and prints sanity checks. Using the cd4 subset as a reference to intersect pathway genes works, although consider checking for gene presence in both subsets if expression differences are expected.
• The IL2/IL7 pathway gene signature is straightforwardly defined and filtered. However, if none of the genes are present, the code only raises a warning; you might want to add a conditional to avoid running sc.tl.score_genes with an empty list.
• The use of sc.tl.score_genes to compute pathway scores and the subsequent Spearman correlations is well executed; printing and plotting the results makes the analysis transparent.
• The visualization via seaborn regplots with regression lines and annotations is well implemented and adheres to the guideline of displaying figures.
• Overall, comments and variable naming are clear, and the code follows the prescribed package list and guidelines.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan clearly defines distinct, hypothesis–driven steps that focus on IL2/IL7 signaling in T cells, avoiding overlap with previous analyses and the original paper.
• The plan’s steps (subsetting, gene signature definition, pathway scoring, correlation analysis, visualization) are logically sequenced and target a specific molecular signature.
• Incorporating correlation with DPS (days post symptom onset) is a novel way to investigate disease progression relative to pathway activity.
• The approach maintains self‐containment by only using data from the anndata object and available metadata.
• Future steps could extend this analysis by comparing to additional cell types or integrating pseudotime if further resolution on T cell states is desired, while ensuring the focus remains on the IL2/IL7 signaling hypothesis.

Overall, both the code and the analysis plan are well aligned with the core hypothesis and the required guidelines.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results show a weak positive correlation between the IL2/IL7 pathway score and Days Post Symptom Onset (DPS) in both CD4 and CD8 T cells, with Spearman's rho values of 0.03 and 0.04, respectively. Although the correlations are statistically significant (p-values < 0.05), the correlation coefficients indicate a very weak relationship. 

### Feedback and Recommendations:

1. **Biological Context**: 
   - The weak correlation suggests that changes in the IL2/IL7 pathway over time may not be strongly related to the duration of symptoms in T cells for this context. Consider if the pathway selection truly aligns with the biological processes relevant to severe COVID-19.

2. **Pathway Analysis**:
   - Further analyze whether other pathways might show stronger correlation or significance by expanding the pathway analysis to include other relevant cytokine pathways, such as those involving TNF, IL1, or IL6, as they are central to the paper’s hypotheses.

3. **Longitudinal Analysis**:
   - Consider performing a longitudinal analysis using a mixed-effects model to evaluate more complex relationships between symptom progression and immune response, accounting for individual variability across patients.

4. **Integration with Existing Data**:
   - Integrate these findings with other clinical and molecular data from the dataset, such as gene expression changes or clinical severity scores, to provide a more comprehensive interpretation.

5. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Compare these results with data from healthy controls to understand if the observed changes are unique to severe COVID-19.

6. **Subpopulation Analysis**:
   - Given the heterogeneity within the T cell populations, explore sub-clustering to see if specific subpopulations exhibit stronger correlations with DPS.

7. **Further Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Use these insights to refine hypotheses on immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 and inform the selection of targeted biomarkers or pathways for future analyses.

These steps could refine the understanding of T cell involvement in severe COVID-19 and potentially identify novel immune dysregulation mechanisms.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
An inflammatory cytokine receptor signature (comprising TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, and IL6R) may reveal a stronger, more biologically relevant relationship with Days Post Symptom Onset (DPS) in T cells compared to the previously examined IL2/IL7 pathway, and its dysregulation in severe COVID-19 may be distinct from healthy controls.

Analysis Plan:
["Subset T cells (CD4 and CD8) from both COVID-19 and Healthy samples using the metadata 'Status' and 'cell_type_coarse'.", 'Define an inflammatory pathway signature using the genes TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, and IL6R and ensure these genes are present in the dataset.', 'Compute the inflammatory pathway score in each subset (COVID and Healthy for both CD4 and CD8 T cells) using sc.tl.score_genes.', 'Perform Spearman correlation analyses in each group to assess the relationship between DPS and the inflammatory pathway score.', 'Generate scatter plots with regression lines (and optionally violin plots) that compare the DPS versus inflammatory score trends between COVID-19 and Healthy T cells.']

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan Feedback:
– The plan is clear, focused, and distinct from previous IL2/IL7 pathway analyses. It targets an inflammatory cytokine receptor signature in T cells and compares COVID‐19 versus Healthy cells, addressing an important hypothesis.
– Each step is clearly defined from subsetting, signature validation, scoring, correlation analysis, to visualization. This sequential approach ensures reproducibility and clarity.
– The plan appropriately leverages available metadata (Status, cell_type_coarse, DPS) and includes relevant statistical tests (Spearman correlation) with visual summaries.
– A suggestion would be to consider additional statistical corrections (e.g., multiple testing adjustments) if extending the analyses further, and possibly exploring alternative visual summaries (e.g., boxplots) for complementary insights.

• Python Code Feedback (First Step):
– The code correctly subsets T cells for COVID and Healthy samples using metadata, and prints cell counts as a sanity check.
– The signature genes (TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R) are validated within each subset, and a warning is raised if not all are present. This demonstrates robust error handling.
– The use of sc.tl.score_genes is appropriate for computing the inflammatory pathway score. Converting DPS to numeric ensures proper statistical analysis.
– The defined helper function for gene validation and the subsequent application to each subset keeps the code modular and readable.
– The Spearman correlation function is well-implemented, printing results with proper formatting.
– Visualization code using seaborn regplot for scatter plots with regression lines and violin plots for score distributions is clear, with titles, labels, and legends appropriately set.
– Overall, the code follows the provided guidelines, uses only allowed packages, and builds on established analysis practices without overlapping previous analyses.
– Minor improvement: Consider handling datasets where none of the signature genes are present more explicitly (e.g., exiting with an informative message) to avoid running unnecessary computations.

This analysis plan and code provide a solid, novel approach to evaluating inflammatory cytokine receptor expression in T cells relative to disease progression.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

### Feedback:

1. **Cell Count Results**:
   - There's a higher count of CD4 and CD8 T cells in COVID-19 samples compared to healthy controls. This indicates an immune response but requires further exploration to understand the specific roles these cells might play.

2. **Inflammatory Score**:
   - The correlation between the inflammatory score and days post symptom onset (DPS) is very weak for both CD4 and CD8 T cells in COVID samples, with low rho values and p-values indicating marginal significance for CD8 cells. For healthy samples, the analysis returned `nan`, suggesting inappropriate data or calculation errors.
   - The correlation results might not be meaningful for differentiating between conditions based solely on the inflammatory score and DPS.

3. **Score Distributions**:
   - The distribution of the inflammatory scores shows overlap between COVID and healthy samples for both CD4 and CD8 T cells. This indicates the inflammatory score might not be a strong differentiator on its own.

4. **Future Steps**:
   - **Explore Additional Markers**: Consider including other markers or scores that might be more sensitive to changes specific to COVID-19 infection, like those related to cytokine expression.
   - **Subset Analysis**: Since significant differences were not observed at a general level, delving into specific T cell subsets or utilizing additional dimensionality reduction techniques might uncover nuanced patterns.
   - **Pathway Enrichment**: Conduct pathway enrichment analysis based on differential expression in T cells, focusing on pathways relevant to inflammation and immune signaling.
   - **Beyond Inflammatory Scores**: Investigate other potential indicators such as T cell exhaustion markers or specific ligand-receptor interaction analysis focused on immune signaling pathways.
   - **Correction of Errors**: Investigate why `nan` results were obtained for healthy samples to ensure accurate data processing and analyses.
   - **Insight from Other Cells**: Explore interactions with other immune cells (e.g., monocytes) to build on the hypothesis of dysregulated communication between these populations.

The current results provide a baseline but suggest the need for more detailed and targeted analyses to support the hypothesis regarding T cell communication and COVID-19 pathology.

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Prolonged COVID-19 disease duration is associated with increased mitochondrial stress in adaptive immune cells, as measured by a mitochondrial gene signature score that reflects altered mitochondrial metabolism in these cells.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset CD4 and CD8 T cells from both COVID-19 and Healthy samples as in previous steps.', 'Define a mitochondrial stress gene signature using common mitochondrial genes (e.g. MT-CO1, MT-CO2, MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ATP6) and verify their presence in the dataset.', 'Compute a mitochondrial stress score for each T cell subset using sc.tl.score_genes, which quantifies the expression of the mitochondrial gene signature.', 'Assess the relationship between the mitochondrial stress scores and days post symptom onset (DPS) using Spearman correlation in each T cell subset and condition.', 'Visualize the results via scatter plots with regression lines and supplementary boxplots to compare score distributions between COVID-19 and Healthy groups.']

Feedback:
• The code for step one is well structured and clearly implements subsetting of the T cell populations, validation of the mitochondrial gene signature, scoring via sc.tl.score_genes, and follows through with correlation analysis and visualization. It adheres to the stipulated package constraints and builds on prior analyses without overlap.

• The use of a helper function (get_valid_mt_genes) for ensuring only genes present in each subset are used is a good practice. Consider also logging the specific missing genes to aid troubleshooting if the signature isn’t fully present.

• Converting DPS to numeric and checking for NaNs is handled properly, ensuring the subsequent correlation tests are valid.

• The creation of DataFrames for visualization and the combined scatter plus boxplot figures is efficient and clear. Adding annotations (e.g., showing correlation coefficients and p-values directly on the plots) might further enhance result interpretation.

• The analysis plan is focused and distinct from previous work by quantifying mitochondrial stress rather than inflammatory markers or cell–cell interactions. It leverages a well‐defined gene signature, uses appropriate statistical tests (Spearman correlation), and incorporates thorough data visualization.

• Overall, the code and plan are self-contained, reproducible, and appropriately extend the previous analyses without redundancy.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The analysis of the mitochondrial stress score provides some interesting insights, especially in the context of COVID-19. Here's what stands out and potential next steps:

1. **CD4 and CD8 T Cells Analysis**:
   - In COVID-19 patients, the negative correlation between DPS (Days Post Symptom Onset) and mitochondrial stress score indicates a potential decline in stress as time progresses. The correlations are weak (rho = -0.10 and rho = -0.04) but significant due to large p-values.
   - For healthy controls, data is missing (nan), which makes direct comparisons difficult. Ensuring complete data for healthy individuals would be crucial for a robust comparison.

2. **Boxplot Observations**:
   - The distribution of mitochondrial stress scores doesn't show a stark difference between COVID-19 and healthy individuals, which suggests that factors other than mitochondrial stress may be influencing disease progression or severity.
   - Consider expanding this analysis to other immune cell types to identify differential stress responses.

3. **Hypothesis Validation**:
   - The original hypothesis in the research paper involves enhanced interaction between monocytes and T cells driven by inflammatory signals. While mitochondrial stress may not directly confirm this hypothesis, it could be a complementary factor.
   - Exploring whether mitochondrial stress score correlates with markers of cytokine release or T cell exhaustion could provide more insight into the biological relevance.

4. **Further Steps**:
   - Validate these findings using additional datasets, if available, to ensure replicability.
   - Investigate other parameters such as metabolic activity or mitochondrial biogenesis, which might be more indicative of dynamic changes in T cells during COVID-19 progression.
   - Given the unique focus of the paper on inflammatory ligand-receptor interactions, consider incorporating analyses of mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathways and their regulation by inflammatory signals.

5. **Technical Considerations**:
   - Ensure a robust control gene selection for computing the mitochondrial stress score. Variation in control gene count suggests potential inconsistencies that could affect results.
   - Address the missing data for healthy individuals to provide a complete picture. Consider imputation techniques or re-evaluation of data collection processes.

Iterating on these suggestions can help better align the findings with the original hypothesis and contribute to a nuanced understanding of COVID-19 immunopathology.

PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps.

Here are the previous analyses attempted:
In severe COVID‐19 patients, key immune cells (particularly CD14 Monocytes and dendritic cells) exhibit stronger coordination between antigen presentation (HLA1) and interferon response (IFN1) compared to healthy controls, suggesting dysregulated immune signaling that could contribute to disease severity.
In severe COVID-19, prolonged disease duration (reflected by higher DPS values) is associated with increased mitochondrial stress in adaptive immune cells (specifically CD4 T and CD8 T cells), suggesting that extended immune activation leads to metabolic dysregulation.


Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
The paper focuses on severe COVID-19, a condition induced by SARS‑CoV‑2 infection that, in a subset of patients, progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.

Biological background  
Key biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.

Paper’s computational analyses  
A series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: In severe COVID-19, immune cells—particularly T cells and monocytes—exhibit altered ribosomal content, which may reflect a dysregulated translation machinery that is coupled with an enhanced interferon response.

Analysis Plan:
1. Subset the dataset by disease status (COVID versus Healthy) to compare ribosomal content differences within these groups.
2. Plot the distributions of ribosomal metrics (percent_rpl, percent_rps, percent_rrna) across all cells using violin plots to get an initial overview of differences between disease states.
3. Focus on key immune cell types (e.g., CD4 T, CD8 T, CD14 Monocyte, and CD16 Monocyte) by subsetting the data based on cell_type_coarse or cell_type_fine annotations, and rerun the ribosomal content visualization for these specific groups.
4. Conduct statistical tests (using the Mann-Whitney U test from scipy.stats) to evaluate whether the differences in ribosomal metrics between COVID and Healthy groups in these key cell types are significant.
5. Perform correlation analysis between ribosomal metrics and IFN1 expression in these immune subsets, and create scatter plots with regression lines displayed in a grid layout to illustrate potential associations between translation machinery activity and interferon response.

Initial Code:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Check unique disease statuses
print('Disease statuses:', adata.obs['Status'].unique())

# Violin plot for percent_rpl across COVID and Healthy cells
sc.pl.violin(adata, keys='percent_rpl', groupby='Status', jitter=0.4, rotation=45, show=True)

# Violin plot for percent_rps across COVID and Healthy cells
sc.pl.violin(adata, keys='percent_rps', groupby='Status', jitter=0.4, rotation=45, show=True)

# Violin plot for percent_rrna across COVID and Healthy cells
sc.pl.violin(adata, keys='percent_rrna', groupby='Status', jitter=0.4, rotation=45, show=True)

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
In severe COVID-19, immune cells—particularly T cells and monocytes—exhibit altered ribosomal content, which may reflect a dysregulated translation machinery that is coupled with an enhanced interferon response.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the dataset by disease status (COVID versus Healthy) to compare ribosomal content differences within these groups.', 'Plot the distributions of ribosomal metrics (percent_rpl, percent_rps, percent_rrna) across all cells using violin plots to get an initial overview of differences between disease states.', 'Focus on key immune cell types (e.g., CD4 T, CD8 T, CD14 Monocyte, and CD16 Monocyte) by subsetting the data based on cell_type_coarse or cell_type_fine annotations, and rerun the ribosomal content visualization for these specific groups.', 'Conduct statistical tests (using the Mann-Whitney U test from scipy.stats) to evaluate whether the differences in ribosomal metrics between COVID and Healthy groups in these key cell types are significant.', 'Perform correlation analysis between ribosomal metrics and IFN1 expression in these immune subsets, and create scatter plots with regression lines displayed in a grid layout to illustrate potential associations between translation machinery activity and interferon response.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Check unique disease statuses
print('Disease statuses:', adata.obs['Status'].unique())

# Violin plot for percent_rpl across COVID and Healthy cells
sc.pl.violin(adata, keys='percent_rpl', groupby='Status', jitter=0.4, rotation=45, show=True)

# Violin plot for percent_rps across COVID and Healthy cells
sc.pl.violin(adata, keys='percent_rps', groupby='Status', jitter=0.4, rotation=45, show=True)

# Violin plot for percent_rrna across COVID and Healthy cells
sc.pl.violin(adata, keys='percent_rrna', groupby='Status', jitter=0.4, rotation=45, show=True)

Feedback:
Feedback on Python Code:
• The code is well-organized and clearly implements the first step – checking disease statuses and generating separate violin plots for the ribosomal metrics.
• It correctly uses the “Status” column to group cells, which aligns with the hypothesis.
• Consider combining multiple violin plots into a grid layout (using matplotlib’s subplots) to facilitate side‐by‐side comparison, as suggested by the guidelines.
• Although not strictly necessary at this step, adding comments to indicate the purpose of each plot could further improve readability.
• Ensure that “show=True” is consistently used so that all figures are immediately visible.

Feedback on Analysis Plan:
• The analysis plan is clear and aligns well with the hypothesis by focusing on potential alterations in ribosomal content and its association with interferon response.
• It uniquely differs from previous analyses and those in the paper by zooming in on ribosomal metrics rather than focusing on cell proportions or depletion/enrichment of subsets.
• The planned subsetting of immune cell types (CD4 T, CD8 T, CD14 Monocyte, and CD16 Monocyte) is appropriate given their biological relevance.
• Incorporating statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U tests) to evaluate differences, as well as correlation analyses with IFN1 expression, strengthens the robustness of the approach.
• The plan to visualize results in a grid layout (for scatter plots with regression lines) adds clarity to the potential associations.
• Overall, the plan is self-contained and makes optimal use of the available metadata while maintaining focus on the central hypothesis.



Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: In severe COVID-19, immune cells—particularly T cells and monocytes—exhibit altered ribosomal content, which may reflect a dysregulated translation machinery that is coupled with an enhanced interferon response.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Subset the dataset by disease status (COVID versus Healthy) and assess ribosomal content differences using combined grid-layout violin plots for enhanced visual comparisons.
2. Plot the distributions of ribosomal metrics (percent_rpl, percent_rps, percent_rrna) across all cells, employing a grid layout to facilitate side-by-side evaluation of differences between disease states.
3. Focus on key immune cell types (e.g., CD4 T, CD8 T, CD14 Monocyte, and CD16 Monocyte) by subsetting the data based on cell type annotations, then rerun the ribosomal content visualizations for these specific groups.
4. Conduct statistical tests (using the Mann-Whitney U test from scipy.stats) to evaluate whether differences in ribosomal metrics between COVID and Healthy groups in these immune subsets are significant, and print the results.
5. Perform correlation analysis between ribosomal metrics and IFN1 expression in these immune subsets, creating scatter plots with regression lines displayed in a grid layout to illustrate associations between translation machinery activity and interferon response.

Revised Code:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Check unique disease statuses to verify the data grouping
print('Disease statuses:', adata.obs['Status'].unique())

# Create a grid layout with 1 row and 3 columns for violin plots
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(18, 6))

# Violin plot for percent_rpl across COVID and Healthy cells
# This plot shows the distribution of ribosomal protein large subunit content
sc.pl.violin(adata, keys='percent_rpl', groupby='Status', jitter=0.4, rotation=45, ax=axes[0], show=False)
axes[0].set_title('percent_rpl by Status')

# Violin plot for percent_rps across COVID and Healthy cells
# This plot shows the distribution of ribosomal protein small subunit content
sc.pl.violin(adata, keys='percent_rps', groupby='Status', jitter=0.4, rotation=45, ax=axes[1], show=False)
axes[1].set_title('percent_rps by Status')

# Violin plot for percent_rrna across COVID and Healthy cells
# This plot shows the distribution of ribosomal RNA content
sc.pl.violin(adata, keys='percent_rrna', groupby='Status', jitter=0.4, rotation=45, ax=axes[2], show=False)
axes[2].set_title('percent_rrna by Status')

# Adjust layout and display all generated figures

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current analysis presents violin plots comparing the percentages of ribosomal protein genes (RPL, RPS) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls.

**Feedback and Recommendations:**

1. **Ribosomal Content as a Variable:**
   - Differences in ribosomal protein gene percentages can indicate changes in protein synthesis machinery. However, if these differences are not directly related to the hypothesis on immune cell signaling, further exploration might be necessary to understand their relevance to immune dysregulation.

2. **Associations with Immune Cell Function:**
   - Investigate whether these ribosomal content differences correlate with specific immune cell types or states. This could indicate altered protein synthesis related to immune activation or exhaustion.
   - Consider pathway enrichment analysis on genes differentially expressed in cells with varying ribosomal content to identify biological processes affected.

3. **Relating to Hypothesis:**
   - Find if monocytes, T cells, or other immune cells show specific alterations in ribosomal content, reflecting their roles in cytokine signaling or immune response modulation during severe COVID-19.
   - Specifically assess if changes in ribosomal proteins correlate with expression levels of inflammatory ligands or receptors (e.g., TNF, IL1B), aligning with the hypothesis regarding dysregulated monocyte-T cell communication.

4. **Future Steps:**
   - Extend this analysis to include other cellular stress markers, such as mitochondrial content, as previous analyses have indicated a link to metabolic stress correlated with disease duration.
   - Perform deeper subclustering to explore if specific immune cell subsets are driving the observed differences, potentially identifying new targets for therapy.

These steps ensure the analysis stays distinct from the referenced paper by emphasizing novel connections between ribosomal content and immune signaling pathways, potentially leading to new insights into the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Ribosomal content variations are associated with altered expression of key inflammatory ligands, suggesting that dysregulated translation machinery may contribute to aberrant immune cell signaling in severe COVID-19.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the anndata object for key immune cell types of interest: CD14 Monocyte, CD16 Monocyte, CD4 T, and CD8 T.', 'For each cell type, extract the ribosomal protein large subunit percentage (percent_rpl) from the cell metadata and the expression levels of inflammatory genes (TNF and IL1B) from the expression matrix.', 'Generate scatter plots for each cell type and for each marker gene (TNF and IL1B), using different colors for COVID and Healthy statuses.', 'Compute Spearman correlation coefficients for percent_rpl versus the gene expression of TNF and IL1B in each cell type, annotating each scatter plot with the correlation statistic and p-value.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy import stats

# Define cell types and inflammatory genes of interest
cell_types = ['CD14 Monocyte', 'CD16 Monocyte', 'CD4 T', 'CD8 T']
inflammatory_genes = ['TNF', 'IL1B']

# Set up a color palette for disease statuses
status_colors = {'COVID': 'red', 'Healthy': 'blue'}

# Create subplots: rows = number of cell types, columns = number of inflammatory genes
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=len(cell_types), ncols=len(inflammatory_genes), figsize=(16, 24), sharex=False, sharey=False)

# Loop over each cell type and inflammatory gene
for i, ct in enumerate(cell_types):
    # Subset the data for the given cell type
    adata_ct = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == ct]
    # Get the percent_rpl metric from obs
    ribo_values = adata_ct.obs['percent_rpl'].values
    
    for j, gene in enumerate(inflammatory_genes):
        ax = axes[i, j]

        # Check if gene is in the dataset
        if gene not in adata_ct.var_names:
            ax.text(0.5, 0.5, f"{gene} not found", horizontalalignment='center', verticalalignment='center')
            continue

        # Extract gene expression values; if sparse, convert to dense array and flatten
        expr = np.array(adata_ct[:, gene].X).flatten()

        # Prepare a DataFrame for convenience
        df = pd.DataFrame({
            'percent_rpl': ribo_values,
            gene: expr,
            'Status': adata_ct.obs['Status'].values
        })

        # Plot scatter for each disease status
        for status in df['Status'].unique():
            subset = df[df['Status'] == status]
            ax.scatter(subset['percent_rpl'], subset[gene], 
                       color=status_colors.get(status, 'gray'), 
                       alpha=0.6, label=status if i==0 and j==0 else "")

        # Compute Spearman correlation for the full subset (ignoring status splitting)
        corr, pval = stats.spearmanr(df['percent_rpl'], df[gene])
        
        # Annotate the plot with correlation coefficient and p-value
        ax.annotate(f"Spearman r={corr:.2f}\np={pval:.2e}", xy=(0.05, 0.85), xycoords='axes fraction', fontsize=10,
                    bbox=dict(boxstyle='round', facecolor='white', alpha=0.8))

        ax.set_xlabel('percent_rpl')
        ax.set_ylabel(f"{gene} Expression")
        ax.set_title(f"{ct}: percent_rpl vs {gene}")

# Create a legend for disease status only once
handles = [plt.Line2D([0], [0], marker='o', color='w', label=key, markerfacecolor=color, markersize=8) for key, color in status_colors.items()]
fig.legend(handles=handles, loc='upper right')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Feedback:
Feedback on the First Step Code:
1. The code cleanly subsets the anndata object by the specified key immune cell types and plots scatter plots comparing percent_rpl versus inflammatory gene expression. The use of a nested loop to iterate over cell types and genes is efficient and easy to follow.
2. Good practice is shown by checking for the presence of each gene in adata.var_names and annotating the corresponding subplot if a gene is missing.
3. Converting gene expression to a dense NumPy array (when necessary) is handled well. Consider adding a comment if the matrix is sparse to inform future readers.
4. The computation of Spearman correlations for each gene–cell type pairing is implemented appropriately. One potential enhancement could be to also calculate correlations for each disease status separately if subgroup differences are of interest, but the current approach aligns with the stated analysis plan.
5. The subplot layout, annotation, and creation of a unified legend are nicely implemented; these choices ensure clear visualization of the results.
6. All imported packages are within the allowed list, and the code builds on prior analyses without redundancy.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
1. The plan focuses on a novel hypothesis through the lens of ribosomal protein content and inflammatory ligand expression, thereby differentiating from prior analyses that considered antigen presentation and mitochondrial stress.
2. Subsetting by key cell types (CD14 Monocyte, CD16 Monocyte, CD4 T, and CD8 T) is well justified; these populations are central to immune signaling and the pathology of severe COVID-19.
3. Extracting and correlating ribosomal content (percent_rpl) with the expression of TNF and IL1B is a straightforward, hypothesis-driven approach. Visualizations via scatter plots with disease-status color coding will effectively illustrate these relationships.
4. The plan could be further enhanced by including statistical significance reporting (e.g., p-values in a summary table or text output) beyond annotation on the plots to add further rigor.
5. Overall, the plan is self-contained, adheres to the allowed packages, and clearly differentiates itself from previous and paper analyses by focusing on translation machinery’s potential role in immune dysregulation.

Overall, both the code and the analysis plan are well thought out, concise, and aligned with the project guidelines.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current analysis investigates the expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL1B in monocytes and T cells between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. The scatter plots demonstrate expression levels vs. percentage of ribosomal protein genes in different cell types.

Here are some key observations and feedback:

1. **Weak Correlations**: 
   - The Spearman correlation coefficients are very low (near zero) across all cell types and conditions for both TNF and IL1B expressions, suggesting no strong relationship between cytokine expression and ribosomal protein gene percentage.
   - This may imply that ribosomal protein gene expression is not a suitable proxy for inflammation in this context.

2. **Expression Levels**:
   - There’s no apparent increase in the expression of TNF or IL1B in monocytes or T cells of COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. This goes against the hypothesis that these cytokines are upregulated in these cells during severe COVID-19.

3. **Statistical Significance**:
   - P-values are significant for some correlations (e.g., CD14 Monocytes and TNF) but given the low correlation values, these may not be biologically meaningful.

4. **Exploration of Other Markers**:
   - Consider exploring other inflammatory markers or pathways that might be more directly involved in monocyte and T cell interaction in severe COVID-19.
   - Investigate other potential receptor-ligand interactions that could mediate the monocyte-T cell communication pathway focused on in the hypothesis.

5. **Future Steps**:
   - Perform further pathway analysis or network analysis to detect other potential cytokine signaling interactions.
   - Investigate other cell populations that may play a role in driving cytokine expression or immune dysregulation.
   - Consider integrating metadata such as disease severity, treatment history, or other clinical parameters to stratify patients and potentially highlight underlying biological patterns.

Overall, while this step doesn't strongly support the initial hypothesis about cytokine expression, it helps refine focus areas for further investigation, such as alternative signaling pathways and additional cellular interactions potentially contributing to disease severity.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
In severe COVID‐19, dysregulated cell–cell communication might be mediated by an upregulation of inflammatory receptors on T cells, enabling a heightened responsiveness to ligands produced by monocytes. By comparing the expression levels of key receptor genes between COVID‐19 patients and healthy controls within T cells, we can test this hypothesis.

Analysis Plan:
["Subset the anndata object to include only T cells (CD4 T and CD8 T) based on the 'cell_type_coarse' annotation.", 'Select receptor genes (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R) that correspond to inflammatory ligands and assess their expression distributions.', 'Generate grid-layout violin plots of the receptor gene expressions, stratified by disease status (COVID vs Healthy), to visually compare expression differences.', 'Perform Mann‐Whitney U tests to statistically assess differences in receptor gene expression between COVID‐19 and healthy T cells and annotate the plots with the p-values.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:

    # Check if the gene is present in the dataset

Feedback:
Feedback on Analysis Plan:
• The plan is clearly focused on a novel hypothesis regarding dysregulated cell–cell communication in severe COVID‐19. It avoids overlap with the previous analyses and the paper’s computational workflow by concentrating specifically on receptor expression in T cells.
• The choice of a grid-layout violin plot with stratification by disease status paired with Mann–Whitney U tests is appropriate and statistically sound.
• The plan maintains a tight focus on a single core hypothesis while leveraging available metadata and cell‐type annotations.
• Consider integrating additional controls (e.g., adjusting for potential confounders in expression levels) in later analysis steps.

Feedback on First Step Python Code:
• The code cleanly subsets the anndata object to include only CD4 and CD8 T cells by using the ‘cell_type_coarse’ annotation. It adheres to the guideline not to reload the dataset.
• Checking for the presence of each receptor gene in adata_tcells.var_names is good practice to ensure code robustness.
• The code properly handles both sparse and dense expression matrices, ensuring compatibility with the data format.
• The use of seaborn’s violinplot with inner box plot, along with clear annotations of Mann–Whitney U test results, meets the visualization requirements.
• Layout setup via subplots is well implemented, though consider ensuring consistent axis labels and font sizes across all subplots.
• Overall, the code is modular, readable, and adheres to the allowed package usage guidelines. 

Overall, both the analysis plan and the provided code are thorough, focused, and compliant with the project guidelines while introducing a novel angle on COVID‐19 immune dysregulation.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results show a significant upregulation of TNFRSF1A and IL1R1 in T cells from COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (with p-values of 1.59e-07 and 9.41e-03 respectively), indicating enhanced receptor expression. However, IL6R expression does not show a significant difference (p-value of 1.46e-01).

### Feedback:

1. **Promising Results:**
   - The significant increase in TNFRSF1A and IL1R1 expression suggests that communication via TNF and IL1 pathways may be enhanced in severe COVID-19, aligning with the hypothesis that monocyte-T cell interactions are altered.
   - These findings could point towards a notable dysregulation in these pathways, potentially driving immunopathology.

2. **Further Analysis:**
   - **Ligand Analysis:** Investigate whether monocytes in these patients also show upregulation of the corresponding ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B) using DE analysis to confirm the bidirectional nature of this communication.
   - **Pathway Enrichment:** Conduct pathway enrichment analysis on T cells expressing high levels of TNFRSF1A and IL1R1 to explore downstream effects and identify potential therapeutic targets.
   - **Cell-Cell Interaction:** Use cell-cell interaction tools like CellChat or NicheNet to model and visualize communication networks, focusing on identifying other potential dysregulated interactions.
   - **Subset Analysis:** Consider analyzing specific T cell subsets (e.g., CD4+, CD8+, regulatory T cells) to pinpoint which populations are most involved in this dysregulated communication.

3. **Hypothesis Validation:**
   - The observed upregulation supports the hypothesis regarding enhanced monocyte-T cell signaling. To strengthen this, future experiments should include functional assays to validate the effect of this signaling on immune responses in vitro or in vivo.

4. **Iterative Approach:**
   - **Longitudinal Analysis:** If possible, compare the expression patterns over the disease course to understand temporal dynamics.
   - **Contextual Factors:** Include metadata analysis (e.g., patient severity, treatment history) to see if these factors influence receptor expression levels.

By iterating on these findings, you can better understand the role of monocyte-T cell communication in severe COVID-19 and uncover potential therapeutic targets.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Monocytes in severe COVID-19 patients upregulate inflammatory ligands (TNF and IL1B) to augment their communication with T cells, contributing to dysregulated immune signaling.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the data to include only monocytes (CD14 Monocyte and CD16 Monocyte).', 'For each inflammatory ligand gene (TNF and IL1B), extract expression data from the monocyte subset, then perform differential expression analysis comparing COVID and Healthy samples using the Mann-Whitney U test.', "Visualize the distribution of each ligand's expression across the two disease statuses using violin plots with overlaid boxplots and annotate the plots with the statistical test results.", 'Based on these findings, plan further pathway enrichment analysis in monocyte and T cell subsets to delineate downstream signaling events.']

Feedback:
Feedback on the First Step Code:
• The code correctly subsets the AnnData object for monocytes and neatly handles both sparse and dense gene expression data.
• Plotting is effectively implemented with violin plots overlaid by boxplots, and the Mann–Whitney U test is properly applied for the COVID versus Healthy comparison.
• The subplots are dynamically handled (e.g., when there’s only one ligand gene) and annotations are placed to communicate the p-values, which aids in figure interpretation.
• Consider verifying that the gene expression values are appropriately normalized (or log-transformed) prior to statistical testing to ensure comparability.
• The code adheres to the prescribed packages and guidelines, building on the dataset already in memory without reloading it.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is focused and clearly distinct, honing in on monocyte-specific dysregulation of TNF and IL1B in severe COVID‐19 and their potential role in monocyte–T cell communication.
• Using the Mann–Whitney U test for differential expression in the monocyte subset is appropriate and aligns well with the stated hypothesis.
• The plan’s step of visualizing the expression distribution with violin plots (and overlaid boxplots) coupled with statistical annotations is well thought out.
• For robustness, you might consider detailing whether multiple hypothesis testing adjustments will be employed, especially if more genes are added later or if additional comparisons are made.
• Overall, the planned downstream pathway enrichment analysis and integration with T cell subsets provide a logical extension to the core hypothesis while remaining distinct from prior analyses.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results you provided focus on the expression levels of TNF and IL1B in monocytes of COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Here’s my feedback:

1. **Significance of TNF Results:**
   - The TNF expression shows a high level of statistical significance between COVID-19 and healthy controls (p = 3.62e-41). This could indicate that TNF is potentially playing a role in the immune response differentiation between these groups, aligning with the hypothesis that monocytes may enhance inflammatory signaling in severe COVID-19.

2. **Significance of IL1B Results:**
   - The IL1B expression difference has a less significant p-value of 6.68e-02, suggesting that IL1B may not be as strongly differentially expressed between the two groups in this dataset.

3. **Implications for Hypothesis:**
   - While TNF results appear to support the hypothesis of enhanced inflammatory communication in severe COVID-19, the weaker IL1B signal suggests the need for caution before concluding that these cytokines uniformly drive increased cell-cell communication with T cells.
   - Further analysis focusing on other inflammatory ligands besides TNF and IL1B might be beneficial to comprehensively assess the monocyte-driven cytokine signals.

4. **Further Analysis Suggestions:**
   - **Receptor Analysis:** Investigate expression levels of TNF receptors (such as TNFRSF1A) on T cells to examine the full signaling axis.
   - **Broader Cytokine Screening:** Analyze additional inflammatory ligands and corresponding receptors to get a holistic view of the immune interaction network.
   - **Temporal Dynamics:** Consider tracking the expression levels over time to identify any temporal shifts in cytokine signaling that might correspond with disease progression or symptom severity.
   - **Subcluster Exploration:** Explore subclusters within monocytes to identify heterogeneity in cytokine expression and potential differential roles of monocyte subsets.

5. **Novelty and Biological Relevance:**
   - Ensure the novelty of your analysis by going beyond the cytokines already studied in the referenced paper and include different or less characterized interactions. Integrating receptor and ligand expression into pathway analysis can provide deeper insights into the cellular communication disruptions in severe COVID-19.

This step suggests promising directions but indicates the need for further comprehensive analyses to validate and expand upon these initial findings.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Enhanced cell‐cell communication between monocytes and T cells in severe COVID‐19 is mediated by coordinated expression of inflammatory ligands and their receptors, and this coordination can be detected at the donor level as correlated average gene expression between monocyte ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B) and T cell receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1).

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the anndata object to obtain monocyte (CD14 and CD16 Monocyte) and T cell (CD4 and CD8 T) populations.', 'For each donor in the dataset, compute the average expression of selected ligand genes (TNF and IL1B) in monocytes and the corresponding receptor genes (TNFRSF1A and IL1R1) in T cells. Optionally, if IL6 and IL6R are present, include them as additional pairs.', 'Separate the results based on disease status (COVID vs Healthy) using the donor metadata.', 'Generate scatter plots for each ligand–receptor pair, where the x-axis is the average monocyte ligand expression and the y-axis is the average T cell receptor expression per donor, overlaying a regression line.', 'Perform Spearman correlation tests for each ligand–receptor pair across donors within each disease group and annotate the plots with the correlation coefficient and p-value.']

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan Feedback:
 – The plan precisely targets donor-level coordination between monocyte ligands and T cell receptors, aligning well with the hypothesis.  
 – The separation by disease status and the subsequent correlation analyses provide a novel twist distinct from previous work.  
 – Consider addressing potential batch effects or donor variability that might confound average expression values.  
 – Ensure that downstream analyses (e.g., inclusion of additional ligand–receptor pairs if IL6/IL6R are present) are integrated smoothly.

• Code Feedback for the First Step:
 – The code is clearly modularized: subsetting cell types, computing donor-level averages, and generating scatter plots with regression lines.  
 – It correctly handles both sparse and dense expression matrices and checks for gene presence.  
 – The donor loop is well implemented, but including inline comments for each major step (e.g., “Extracting donor-specific expression”) would improve clarity.  
 – The creation of subplots based on the number of pairs is scalable; however, consider checking that the “Status” values exactly match ['COVID', 'Healthy'] to avoid potential misclassification.  
 – While the scatter plots are effective, you might also consider adding a check for a minimal number of cells per donor to ensure robust average expression estimates.  
 – Overall, the code follows the guidelines, uses only the permitted packages, and builds correctly on previous analyses without repeating them.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results from the current analysis step do not support the hypothesis that increased expression of inflammatory ligands and corresponding receptors in monocytes and T cells, respectively, enhances cell-cell communication in severe COVID-19. The Spearman correlation coefficients between TNF and TNFRSF1A, as well as IL1B and IL1R1, are weak and not statistically significant in both COVID-19 and healthy donors. 

Here are some potential next steps and considerations:

1. **Deep Dive into Specific Subsets**: Consider focusing on specific subsets of T cells and monocytes separately rather than averaging all populations. Subsets such as CD8+ T cells or CD14+ monocytes might show different patterns.

2. **Expand Cytokine and Receptor Panel**: Explore additional cytokine-receptor pairs, including IL6 and its receptors, as well as other inflammatory pathways that might exhibit differences.

3. **Utilize Alternative Methods**: Analyze using methods such as joint embedding (via Seurat's Weighted Nearest Neighbor approach) to capture potential ligand-receptor interactions.

4. **Pathway and Network Analyses**: Perform pathway enrichment to identify downstream signaling pathways facilitated by these interactions, which might show differential signaling.

5. **Focus on Clinical Correlations**: Correlate the expression of these markers with clinical parameters such as disease severity or duration to see if there's a latent variable affecting these results.

While the current analysis shows no significant relationship, these approaches might help to uncover cryptic interactions or indirect evidence of the proposed dysregulated communication in severe COVID-19.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
In severe COVID-19, the IL6/IL6R signaling axis in specific immune subsets (CD14 Monocytes and CD4 T cells) might reveal dysregulated cell-cell communication that correlates with clinical progression (DPS) even when other ligand-receptor pairs do not show significant associations.

Analysis Plan:
['Expand the cytokine-receptor analysis by incorporating the IL6 ligand in CD14 Monocytes and its receptor IL6R in CD4 T cells.', 'Perform a donor-level aggregation to compute average IL6 expression in CD14 Monocytes, average IL6R expression in CD4 T cells, and average DPS per donor.', 'Stratify the donor-level data by disease status (COVID and Healthy), and generate scatter plots with regression lines to assess the correlation between IL6 and IL6R expression, as well as between IL6 expression and DPS.', 'Annotate the plots with Spearman correlation coefficients and p-values to evaluate statistical significance across conditions.']

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python Code:
• The code correctly subsets the adata object for CD14 Monocytes and CD4 T cells and aggregates donor-level expression values for IL6 and IL6R, adhering to allowed packages and coding constraints.
• The strategy to check for sparse matrices and flatten the expression arrays before computing averages is appropriate and robust.
• The use of a minimum cell threshold per donor helps ensure robust estimates; consider adding documentation comments about the rationale behind the threshold.
• The plotting function is modular and well-organized. The annotations of Spearman correlation coefficients and p-values are implemented correctly.
• It might be helpful to include a brief comment reminding users that “adata” is pre-loaded (avoiding unnecessary loading operations) and to ensure that this code builds upon the previous analyses.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is focused on a novel extension by targeting the IL6/IL6R signal across a specific monocyte and T cell pair, which distinguishes it from prior analyses.
• Aggregating donor-level data and examining correlations with disease progression (DPS) offers a fresh angle by linking cell‐cell signaling with clinical outcomes.
• The stratification by disease status (COVID vs. Healthy) and the use of scatterplots with regression lines are appropriate and provide clear visual assessments.
• Consider mentioning any potential confounding variables (if available in adata.obs) that might influence the IL6/IL6R expression or DPS, to further strengthen the interpretation.
• Overall, the approach remains focused on the core hypothesis while integrating relevant metadata, ensuring minimal overlap with previous attempts and the analyses in the paper.

Both the code and the analysis plan are well-aligned with the coding guidelines and make effective use of the available metadata in adata.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results presented offer some initial insights, particularly in relation to the hypothesis regarding immune cell communication in severe COVID-19. Here is a breakdown of the findings and potential directions for future analysis:

1. **IL6 and IL6R Expression:**
   - **COVID vs. Healthy:** 
     - The correlation between IL6 and IL6R expression is weak and not significant in COVID patients, but it shows a strong positive correlation in healthy controls. This suggests that the expected upregulation of IL6/IL6R interaction is not evident, challenging the initial hypothesis of enhanced signaling in COVID-19.
   - **Feedback:** Investigate other inflammatory ligand-receptor pairs to identify potential communication pathways. Consider exploring temporal dynamics and varying severity levels to capture more nuanced interactions.

2. **IL6 vs. Disease Progression Score (DPS):**
   - **Correlation in COVID patients is negative** but not significant. This provides no strong evidence that higher IL6 levels correlate with increased disease progression as captured by DPS.
   - **Feedback:** Continue examining DPS in relation to other inflammatory markers and clinical metadata (e.g., severity, duration) to capture compounding factors that may influence progression.

3. **Ribosomal and rRNA Percentages (Violin Plots):**
   - The distribution of percent_rpl, percent_rps, and percent_rrna between COVID and healthy samples appears similar, indicating no apparent dysregulation at this level within the dataset.
   - **Feedback:** While these metrics do not differ significantly, they can be useful normalization factors or controls in other gene expression analyses. Exploring other cellular stress indicators or metabolic changes to delineate immune cell states can provide more context.

4. **Future Directions:**
   - **Focus on Other Cell–Cell Interactions:** Extend analysis to interactions between other pivotal cell types (e.g., monocytes and NK cells) using ligand-receptor pair datasets.
   - **Gene Expression Profiling:** Pursue differential gene expression involving interferon response and antigen presentation pathways, comparing COVID and healthy controls.
   - **Pathway Enrichment and Pseudotime Analysis:** Conduct pathway enrichment analyses and apply pseudotime analysis to identify distinct trajectories in immune cell differentiation during COVID-19 progression.

Revising and extending these analyses could lead to greater elucidation of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19, potentially revealing novel therapeutic targets.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
CD14 Monocytes in COVID‐19 follow distinct differentiation trajectories that correlate with an altered interferon response, indicating a shift in cell state progression that is not captured by static expression metrics.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the anndata object to include only CD14 Monocytes.', 'Recompute the k-nearest neighbors and run diffusion pseudotime (DPT) analysis to obtain a pseudotime ordering for these cells.', 'Visualize pseudotime distributions as violin plots comparing COVID versus Healthy samples.', 'Examine the relationship between DPT pseudotime and IFN1 expression by generating a scatter plot with a regression line and annotating the Spearman correlation to assess the dynamics of interferon response along the pseudotime trajectory.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Subset the data to include only CD14 Monocytes
adata_mono = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'CD14 Monocyte'].copy()

# Preprocess the subset (if not already normalized) and compute neighbors
# Here we assume the data is preprocessed, so we directly compute the neighborhood graph
sc.pp.neighbors(adata_mono, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30)

# Compute diffusion pseudotime ordering
sc.tl.dpt(adata_mono)

# Retrieve the computed pseudotime
pseudotime = adata_mono.obs['dpt_pseudotime']

# Create a DataFrame with pseudotime, disease status, and IFN1 expression from metadata
# (IFN1 is provided in adata.obs as metadata)
df_pt = pd.DataFrame({
    'dpt_pseudotime': pseudotime,
    'Status': adata_mono.obs['Status'].values,
    'IFN1': adata_mono.obs['IFN1'].values
})

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan Feedback:
 – The hypothesis of correlating differentiation trajectories in CD14 Monocytes with dynamic IFN1 response is compelling and novel relative to prior static analyses.
 – The plan is clearly delineated into four sequential steps focused on CD14 Monocytes, ensuring minimal overlap with previous work.
 – It would be beneficial to mention how the root cell for DPT is chosen (or note that default behavior is acceptable) to aid reproducibility.
 – Consider specifying criteria for quality control (e.g., ensuring proper normalization/scale) before running neighbors and DPT if not already performed.

• Code Feedback:
 – The code is concise, clearly commented, and follows the provided coding guidelines.
 – The subsetting for CD14 Monocytes, computation of neighbors, and application of sc.tl.dpt are correctly implemented.
 – While the script assumes preprocessed data, it may be useful to include a brief comment reminding the user to confirm normalization status—especially since expression metrics (like IFN1) are later used.
 – The pseudotime data is properly extracted and incorporated into a DataFrame along with ‘Status’ and ‘IFN1’, setting a clear basis for the subsequent comparative visualizations.
 – Both the violin plot (to compare pseudotime distributions) and the scatter plot with regression (to relate pseudotime with IFN1 expression) are well-constructed. The use of Spearman correlation with appropriate annotation is a nice touch.
 – Overall, the code builds logically on previous analyses without redundancy and maintains consistent style and appropriate package usage.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results present several insights but also show challenges in supporting the hypothesis:

1. **Interactions Between Monocytes and T Cells:**
   - The correlation between IL6 and its receptor IL6R in COVID and healthy conditions suggests a different pattern. The Spearman correlation is negative for COVID and positive for healthy samples, yet the significance is low in COVID. This indicates that increased IL6 expression in monocytes does not strongly correlate with higher IL6R expression in T cells in COVID patients, which may challenge the hypothesis of enhanced signaling.
   
2. **Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT) in CD14 Monocytes:**
   - The DPT distribution indicates broader pseudotime progression in COVID versus healthy, which can suggest disease-related progression states. This supports the idea of altered monocyte behavior in COVID but needs follow-up analysis to link with specific immunological functions and interactions.

3. **IFN1 Expression vs. DPT:**
   - A weak negative correlation between IFN1 expression and pseudotime in CD14 monocytes suggests some association with temporal progression, yet the small effect size challenges strong biological relevance.

4. **Quality Metrics:**
   - The variations in percent ribosomal protein, rRNA, and mitochondrial percentages between COVID and healthy conditions warrant further exploration. Differences could reflect cellular stress or metabolic changes due to COVID but need to be contextualized with functional assays or pathway analyses.

### Recommendations:

- **Refinement of Ligand-Receptor Analysis:**
  Conduct a more detailed expression analysis focusing on additional cytokines and their receptors, potentially incorporating a broader set of inflammatory ligands (like TNF and IL1B) and corresponding receptors in T cells. 

- **Pseudotime Analysis:**
  Perform pathway enrichment and gene set variation analyses (GSVA) on cells along pseudotime trajectories, particularly in CD14 monocytes, to identify specific programs or pathways that might be driving the observed differences.

- **Subpopulation Exploration:**
  Use clustering to explore potential subpopulations within CD14 monocytes and T cells that might show differential expression of key ligands and receptors that are missed in bulk analysis. 

- **Validation with Functional Studies:**
  Consider validating findings with orthogonal experiments, such as flow cytometry for surface receptor expression and cytokine assays to test functional responses to immune signaling triggers.

These additional analyses can help further explore how dysregulated cell-cell communication may contribute to COVID-19 immunopathology and whether the current hypothesis of enhanced monocyte-T cell interactions holds true in severe disease contexts.

PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps.

Here are the previous analyses attempted:
In severe COVID‐19 patients, key immune cells (particularly CD14 Monocytes and dendritic cells) exhibit stronger coordination between antigen presentation (HLA1) and interferon response (IFN1) compared to healthy controls, suggesting dysregulated immune signaling that could contribute to disease severity.
In severe COVID-19, prolonged disease duration (reflected by higher DPS values) is associated with increased mitochondrial stress in adaptive immune cells (specifically CD4 T and CD8 T cells), suggesting that extended immune activation leads to metabolic dysregulation.
In severe COVID-19, immune cells—particularly T cells and monocytes—exhibit altered ribosomal content, which may reflect a dysregulated translation machinery that is coupled with an enhanced interferon response.


Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
The paper focuses on severe COVID-19, a condition induced by SARS‑CoV‑2 infection that, in a subset of patients, progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.

Biological background  
Key biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.

Paper’s computational analyses  
A series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: In severe COVID‐19, platelets exhibit sex-specific transcriptional differences in genes related to activation and coagulation, which may underlie clinically observed differences in thrombotic risk between males and females.

Analysis Plan:
1. Subset the data to include only COVID-19 patient cells that are annotated as Platelets in the cell_type_coarse metadata field.
2. Perform quality control and normalization on the platelet subset if needed to ensure robust downstream comparisons.
3. Conduct a differential expression analysis comparing male and female platelets using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test via Scanpy's rank_genes_groups function.
4. Visualize the top differentially expressed genes with a heatmap and dotplot, arranging the figures in a grid to observe expression patterns across sexes.
5. Statistically evaluate the significance of the observed differences by outputting the expression statistics (p-values, log-fold changes) for the top genes, and discuss potential biological implications.

Initial Code:
platelet_adata = adata[(adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'Platelet') & (adata.obs['Status'] == 'COVID')].copy()
print('Platelet subset shape:', platelet_adata.shape)
print('Unique sexes in Platelet subset:', platelet_adata.obs['Sex'].unique())

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
In severe COVID‐19, platelets exhibit sex-specific transcriptional differences in genes related to activation and coagulation, which may underlie clinically observed differences in thrombotic risk between males and females.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the data to include only COVID-19 patient cells that are annotated as Platelets in the cell_type_coarse metadata field.', 'Perform quality control and normalization on the platelet subset if needed to ensure robust downstream comparisons.', "Conduct a differential expression analysis comparing male and female platelets using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test via Scanpy's rank_genes_groups function.", 'Visualize the top differentially expressed genes with a heatmap and dotplot, arranging the figures in a grid to observe expression patterns across sexes.', 'Statistically evaluate the significance of the observed differences by outputting the expression statistics (p-values, log-fold changes) for the top genes, and discuss potential biological implications.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
platelet_adata = adata[(adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'Platelet') & (adata.obs['Status'] == 'COVID')].copy()
print('Platelet subset shape:', platelet_adata.shape)
print('Unique sexes in Platelet subset:', platelet_adata.obs['Sex'].unique())

Feedback:
Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is well‐structured and keeps the focus tightly on the sex‐specific transcriptional differences in platelets during COVID‐19. It clearly outlines data subsetting, quality control, differential expression using a nonparametric test, visualization, and statistical reporting, which is distinct from previous analyses.
• It would be beneficial to mention specific quality control metrics (such as mitochondrial percentage or gene count thresholds) for the platelet subset before normalization, to ensure consistency in filtering.
• Consider briefly noting how potential batch effects or sample confounders will be addressed before proceeding to differential expression analysis.
• The plan adheres to the guidelines by relying solely on the contained metadata and avoiding overlap with earlier analyses.

Feedback on the Python Code for the First Step:
• The code correctly subsets the data to include only COVID‐19 platelets, ensuring that the cell_type_coarse and Status fields are appropriately filtered.
• The use of .copy() is appropriate to avoid modifying the original dataset.
• It is good practice to include inline comments that explain each filtering step, which would help future readers understand the logic at a glance.
• Additionally, you might consider adding a check for the number of cells per sex or other QC metrics (e.g., nCount_RNA, percent_mt) at this stage to verify data quality before proceeding to normalization.
• Overall, the code follows the prescribed guidelines and builds appropriately on previous analyses without repetition.

Overall, both the plan and the code are clear and focused on the core hypothesis, with minor improvements suggested for additional quality checks and documentation.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: In severe COVID‐19, platelets exhibit sex-specific transcriptional differences in genes related to activation and coagulation, potentially contributing to the clinically observed differences in thrombotic risk between males and females.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Subset the data to include only COVID-19 patient cells annotated as Platelets in the cell_type_coarse field.
2. Apply stringent quality control on the platelet subset by evaluating metrics such as mitochondrial percentage and gene count thresholds to ensure robust downstream comparisons.
3. Assess potential batch effects or sample confounders that may impact the analysis before normalization.
4. Conduct differential expression analysis comparing male and female platelets using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test via Scanpy's rank_genes_groups function.
5. Visualize the top differentially expressed genes with heatmaps and dotplots arranged in a grid to reveal expression patterns across sexes.
6. Report expression statistics including p-values and log-fold changes for top genes and discuss their potential biological implications.

Revised Code:
platelet_adata = adata[(adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'Platelet') & (adata.obs['Status'] == 'COVID')].copy()
# Subset the data to obtain COVID-19 platelets

print('Platelet subset shape:', platelet_adata.shape)  # Verify the shape of the subset

# Check for balanced representation of sexes in the subset
print('Unique sexes in Platelet subset:', platelet_adata.obs['Sex'].unique())

# Count the number of cells per sex to assess group sizes
print('Cells per sex:', platelet_adata.obs.groupby('Sex').size())

# Output summary statistics for key QC metrics (e.g., RNA count and mitochondrial percentage)
print('QC metrics summary:', platelet_adata.obs[['nCount_RNA', 'percent_mt']].describe())

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The provided results indicate that the platelet subset data consists entirely of male samples. This is an important factor to consider when interpreting your results, as it could limit the generalizability of findings related to sex-specific differences in immune responses to severe COVID-19. Here are some recommendations and considerations for your future analyses:

1. **Confirm Biological Relevance of Platelets**: Given that the focus of your hypotheses is on monocytes and T cells, the isolation and analysis of a platelet subset might be a secondary interest unless there's a novel hypothesis about their role in immune signaling during severe COVID-19. If so, ensure that their inclusion aligns with the biological questions being asked, or consider integrating findings regarding platelet interactions with other immune cells.

2. **Consider Sex-Based Analyses**: Since all data in the platelet subset is from male samples, consider examining if there are differences in immune cell communication or responses between sexes in the larger dataset, particularly related to your primary hypothesis concerning monocyte and T-cell interactions.

3. **Data Completeness and Cross-validation**: Validate that all intended cell types and population data are accounted for, especially given the observed limitation in the sex diversity of platelet data. This could be critical in further hypothesis testing or in adjusting analytical strategies regarding sex as a biological variable.

4. **Diversify Cell Type Analysis**: Make sure to include the primary immune cell types associated with your hypothesis (monocytes and T cells) in subsequent analyses. Confirm their presence in your dataset and pivot analyses towards evaluating ligand-receptor dynamics as initially hypothesized.

5. **Plan for Statistical Approaches**: Due to the platelet subset being exclusive to one sex, ensure any statistical comparisons account for potential biases or are validated through sex-independent approaches in the broader dataset. Consider performing sex-specific differential expression analyses across other immune cell subsets to identify any divergences in immune activity or communications.

6. **Iteration and Validation**: If future steps reveal specific trends or findings, it may be worthwhile to iterate with additional subset specific analyses or validation experiments to reinforce results. Particularly, focus on experimental validation of key inferences from transcriptomic data, such as ligand-receptor pair upregulation, to confirm proposed mechanisms.

By ensuring these steps are addressed, your analysis will remain comprehensive and robust, particularly in light of the limited diversity in the current platelet subset data. This will allow for a stronger interpretation of how immune cell interactions might contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID-19, in line with your hypothesis.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Enhanced inflammatory communication between monocytes and T cells in severe COVID‐19 patients is reflected by coordinated upregulation of inflammatory ligands in monocytes and corresponding receptors in T cells. We hypothesize that donor-level aggregation of these gene signatures will reveal a positive correlation in severe COVID‐19, distinct from healthy controls.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the anndata object to extract monocytes (CD14 and CD16 Monocytes) and T cells (CD4 and CD8 T cells).', 'Score the monocyte subset for an inflammatory ligand signature (TNF, IL1B, IL6) and the T cell subset for the corresponding receptor signature (TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R) using Scanpy’s score_genes function.', 'Aggregate the median signature scores per donor and condition (COVID vs Healthy), then compute and assess the Pearson correlation between monocyte ligand scores and T cell receptor scores independently for COVID and healthy groups.', 'Visualize the donor-level ligand-receptor scores in scatter plots to illustrate communication differences between conditions.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy import stats

# Subset the data for monocytes and T cells
monocytes = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'].isin(['CD14 Monocyte', 'CD16 Monocyte'])].copy()
t_cells = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'].isin(['CD4 T', 'CD8 T'])].copy()

# Define gene signatures for inflammatory communication
monocyte_genes = ['TNF', 'IL1B', 'IL6']
tcell_genes = ['TNFRSF1A', 'IL1R1', 'IL6R']

# Score the inflammatory signatures in the respective cell types
sc.tl.score_genes(monocytes, gene_list=monocyte_genes, score_name='ligand_score')
sc.tl.score_genes(t_cells, gene_list=tcell_genes, score_name='receptor_score')

# Aggregate median scores per donor and condition
monocyte_scores = monocytes.obs.groupby(['Donor_full', 'Status'])['ligand_score'].median().reset_index()
tcell_scores = t_cells.obs.groupby(['Donor_full', 'Status'])['receptor_score'].median().reset_index()

# Merge the aggregated scores on donor and condition
merged_scores = pd.merge(monocyte_scores, tcell_scores, on=['Donor_full', 'Status'])

# Separate data into COVID and Healthy groups
covid_scores = merged_scores[merged_scores['Status'] == 'COVID']
healthy_scores = merged_scores[merged_scores['Status'] == 'Healthy']

# Compute Pearson correlation for COVID and Healthy groups
covid_corr = stats.pearsonr(covid_scores['ligand_score'], covid_scores['receptor_score'])
healthy_corr = stats.pearsonr(healthy_scores['ligand_score'], healthy_scores['receptor_score'])

print('COVID group Pearson correlation (r, p-value):', covid_corr)
print('Healthy group Pearson correlation (r, p-value):', healthy_corr)

# Visualization: Create scatter plots for both groups
sns.set_style('whitegrid')
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))

sns.scatterplot(x='ligand_score', y='receptor_score', data=covid_scores, ax=axes[0])
axes[0].set_title('COVID Donors: Ligand vs Receptor Scores')
axes[0].set_xlabel('Median Ligand Score (Monocytes)')
axes[0].set_ylabel('Median Receptor Score (T Cells)')

sns.scatterplot(x='ligand_score', y='receptor_score', data=healthy_scores, ax=axes[1])

axes[1].set_ylabel('Median Receptor Score (T Cells)')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python code:
• The code is structurally clear and uses Scanpy functions appropriately to subset the data, score genes, aggregate donor-level metrics, and visualize scatter plots.
• The use of groupby for donor-level median aggregation is appropriate; however, consider adding checks to ensure that donor information is available and that the subsets are nonempty before further processing.
• It might be beneficial to include warnings or error messages if either the monocyte or T cell subsets do not contain the expected cell types or if key genes are not present in the dataset.
• The Pearson correlation tests are computed correctly, and printing the (r, p) values gives good immediate statistical feedback.
• The scatter plots for COVID and Healthy groups are well organized; consider adding regression lines to complement the scatter visualization if that helps illustrate the correlation.

Feedback on the overall analysis plan:
• The hypothesis is clearly distinct from prior analyses and focuses on donor-level aggregation of inflammatory ligand and receptor scores—a novel perspective compared to previous work.
• The plan leverages cell-type–specific scoring and correlation analyses, which is a fresh approach to examining intercellular communication. This novel perspective strengthens the originality of the analysis.
• Ensure that the selection of gene signatures (ligands for monocytes and receptors for T cells) is fully justified by prior biological literature, and verify that these genes are reliably captured in the anndata object.
• The plan would benefit from clearly stating the intended statistical thresholds (e.g., p-value cutoffs) when interpreting significant correlations.
• The visualization step is rigorous; nonetheless, consider preparing additional complementary figures (e.g., adding trend lines or density plots) in later steps if needed. 

Both the code and plan adhere to the provided guidelines and build on past analyses without repeating them.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current analysis attempts to correlate ligand and receptor scores between monocytes and T cells in COVID-19 versus healthy donors, aligning with the hypothesis about disrupted cell communication in severe COVID-19. Here’s some feedback to guide future analyses:

1. **Promising Findings**:
   - The positive correlation observed in both COVID-19 (r = 0.596, p = 0.119) and healthy donors (r = 0.854, p = 0.030) suggests a significant relationship in healthy individuals while being not statistically significant for COVID-19, possibly due to lower power or variability in severe cases.

2. **Hypothesis Validation**:
   - The data does demonstrate a stronger correlation in healthy donors, which may suggest more coordinated signaling in normal conditions. Although the COVID-19 correlation is less robust, it indicates potential dysregulation which could warrant further investigation.

3. **Considerations for Future Analyses**:
   - **Increase Sample Size**: Consider expanding the dataset to enhance statistical power, particularly in the COVID-19 group.
   - **Subset Analysis**: Identify specific patient subgroups (e.g., based on the severity or specific clinical markers) to refine correlation detection.
   - **Temporal Analysis**: Explore temporal changes in ligand-receptor scores to understand dynamic adjustments during disease progression.
   - **Pathway Analysis**: Complement ligand-receptor scoring with pathway enrichment analyses to capture broader biological processes impacted by dysregulation.
   - **Cell-cell Interaction Models**: Leverage computational models to predict potential dysregulated interactions in the immune network beyond monocytes and T cells, integrating other immune cell types.

4. **Biological Insights**:
   - The lack of a significant correlation in COVID-19 samples may suggest varied responses among patients or indicate disruption in typical signaling pathways potentially linked with disease severity. Investigating molecular underpinnings using DE and pathway analysis could provide further insights.
   - Evaluate the expression of specific ligands and receptors in detailed, contrasting their profiles in healthy vs. severe conditions for more targeted hypotheses.

These steps can enhance the understanding of dysregulated communication in severe COVID-19 and contribute to identifying therapeutic targets.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
After rigorous quality control filtering, the platelet subset from COVID‐19 patients will display robust transcriptional profiles, reducing technical noise and enabling confident downstream analysis of sex‐specific differences in gene expression related to activation and coagulation.

Analysis Plan:
['Visualize the distribution of key quality control (QC) metrics (nCount_RNA, nFeature_RNA, and percent_mt) in the COVID‐19 platelet subset to assess overall cell quality.', 'Determine appropriate QC threshold values (e.g., filter out cells with percent_mt above 5% and with nCount_RNA below a lower bound) based on the observed distributions.', 'Apply these filtering criteria to obtain a high-quality platelet subset.', 'Visualize and print summary statistics for QC metrics before and after filtering to confirm improved data quality.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

# Assume platelet_adata is already defined from previous steps

# 1. Plot histograms for key QC metrics in the raw platelet subset
qc_metrics = ['nCount_RNA', 'nFeature_RNA', 'percent_mt']
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(18, 5))
for i, metric in enumerate(qc_metrics):
    sns.histplot(platelet_adata.obs[metric], kde=True, ax=axes[i], color='gray')
    axes[i].set_title(f'Distribution of {metric}')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# 2. Set thresholds based on the data distributions
# Here, we choose to filter out cells with percent_mt >= 0.05 (5%)
# and cells with nCount_RNA <= 500. Adjust thresholds as necessary based on the plots.
mt_threshold = 0.05
nCount_threshold = 500

# 3. Apply filtering to obtain high-quality platelet data
initial_cell_count = platelet_adata.n_obs
filtered_platelet = platelet_adata[(platelet_adata.obs['percent_mt'] < mt_threshold) & (platelet_adata.obs['nCount_RNA'] > nCount_threshold)].copy()
filtered_cell_count = filtered_platelet.n_obs
print(f'Initial number of platelet cells: {initial_cell_count}')
print(f'Number of platelet cells after QC filtering: {filtered_cell_count}')

# 4. Compare QC metrics before and after filtering using violin plots
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(18, 5))
for i, metric in enumerate(qc_metrics):
    sns.violinplot(data=platelet_adata.obs, y=metric, color='lightgray', ax=axes[i], inner='quartile', label='Before')
    sns.violinplot(data=filtered_platelet.obs, y=metric, color='skyblue', ax=axes[i], inner='quartile', label='After')
    axes[i].set_title(f'{metric} Before vs After Filtering')
    axes[i].legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Feedback:
Feedback on the Code:
• The code clearly visualizes the distributions of the three QC metrics using histograms with KDE overlays, then applies defined thresholds to filter the cells. The use of subplots is appropriate and ensures figures are displayed in a cohesive grid.
• The comments are sufficient and the print statements provide useful checkpoints (e.g., initial vs. post-filter cell counts) that confirm quality improvements.
• The violin plot comparisons are a good choice to intuitively assess the effect of filtering across conditions.
• The hardcoded thresholds (percent_mt = 0.05, nCount_RNA = 500) serve as a good starting point. However, consider commenting that these may need adjustment after careful inspection of the data distributions and a brief mention of exploring alternative thresholds.
• The code adheres to the allowed package list and displays figures instead of saving them, in line with the guidelines.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is well-structured and targets the key hypothesis. It appropriately starts by visualizing QC metric distributions, determines thresholds based on these distributions, applies filtering, and finally compares quality before and after filtering.
• You might consider including basic statistical comparisons (e.g., summary statistics with confidence intervals or changes in medians) to more quantitatively confirm that quality has improved after filtering.
• Although the plan is focused on QC, ensure that subsequent steps clearly build on this high-quality dataset to assess the downstream sex-specific transcriptional differences as hypothesized.
• Overall, the analysis plan is distinct from both the paper’s approaches and previous attempts, while remaining self-contained and centered on a single core goal.

Overall, the code and plan are well-aligned, reproducible, and follow the provided guidelines.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current QC filtering step resulted in the removal of all platelet cells, which may indicate overly aggressive filtering criteria. Here are key takeaways and suggestions:

1. **QC Parameters Review**: 
   - Re-evaluate the thresholds for filtering. Completely removing all cells of a type may mask potential biological insights. Consider adjusting thresholds for mitochondrial content or feature counts to retain some platelet cells for analysis.

2. **Reanalysis with Adjusted Criteria**:
   - Iteratively adjust QC criteria to find a balance that retains some platelet cells while ensuring data quality. Focus on maintaining as many biologically plausible cells as possible without introducing noise.

3. **Comparison with Known Phenotypes**:
   - Compare retained cell metrics with known values for platelet characteristics to refine filtering. Platelets typically have low RNA content; if thresholds for nCount_RNA or nFeature_RNA are too stringent, re-evaluate their setting.

4. **Biological Verification**:
   - Cross-verify filtered out cells against expected proportions in disease versus control datasets. Platelets have known roles, potentially including interactions with immune cells, which could be pivotal in COVID-19 pathology.

5. **Alternative Analytical Steps**:
   - Consider downstream clustering or batch correction techniques that might also address quality issues without dismissing an entire cell population.

6. **Pilot Analysis with Different Criteria**:
   - Conduct a smaller-scale pilot analysis using slightly relaxed QC parameters to assess biological consistency of the included platelet population.

Addressing these areas can reveal whether platelet dynamics during severe COVID-19 might contribute to the wider immune response narrative, which is currently unexplored due to full removal post-filtering.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
By refining QC thresholds to better retain platelets in COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that sex-specific transcriptional differences—particularly in genes related to activation and coagulation—will become evident between male and female platelets.

Analysis Plan:
['Adjust the QC filtering parameters for platelet cells by lowering the nCount_RNA threshold and slightly relaxing the percent_mt cutoff to accommodate the low RNA content typical of platelets, ensuring that a sufficient number of cells are retained.', "Perform differential expression analysis on the refined platelet subset by comparing male and female cells using Scanpy's rank_genes_groups with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to identify sex-specific gene expression signatures.", 'Visualize the top differentially expressed genes using heatmaps and dotplots to assess differences in expression patterns and report key statistical metrics such as p-values and log-fold changes.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Use the platelet_adata defined from previous steps (COVID Platelets)
# Define relaxed QC thresholds for platelets due to their low RNA content
adjusted_nCount_threshold = 300
adjusted_mt_threshold = 0.08

# Print initial cell count
initial_cell_count = platelet_adata.n_obs
print(f'Initial number of platelet cells: {initial_cell_count}')

# Apply refined filtering criteria
refined_platelet = platelet_adata[(platelet_adata.obs['nCount_RNA'] > adjusted_nCount_threshold) & \
                                     (platelet_adata.obs['percent_mt'] < adjusted_mt_threshold)].copy()

# Print cell count after refining QC filtering
refined_cell_count = refined_platelet.n_obs
print(f'Number of platelet cells after refined QC filtering: {refined_cell_count}')

# Optional: Visualize QC metrics before and after filtering
qc_metrics = ['nCount_RNA', 'percent_mt']
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))
for i, metric in enumerate(qc_metrics):
    sns.violinplot(data=platelet_adata.obs, y=metric, color='lightgray', ax=axes[i], inner='quartile', label='Before')
    sns.violinplot(data=refined_platelet.obs, y=metric, color='skyblue', ax=axes[i], inner='quartile', label='After')
    axes[i].set_title(f'{metric} Before vs After Refined Filtering')
    axes[i].legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Differential Expression Analysis comparing male and female platelets
# Ensure that there are cells from both sexes
print('Unique sexes in refined platelet subset:', refined_platelet.obs['Sex'].unique())
print('Cells per sex:', refined_platelet.obs['Sex'].value_counts())

# Run differential expression analysis using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(refined_platelet, groupby='Sex', method='wilcoxon', use_raw=False)

# Display top ranked genes for each sex
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap(refined_platelet, groupby='Sex', n_genes=10, show=True, cmap='viridis')
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot(refined_platelet, groupby='Sex', n_genes=10, show=True)

# Extract the DE results into a pandas DataFrame for further inspection
de_results = pd.DataFrame(refined_platelet.uns['rank_genes_groups']['names']).head(10)
print('Top differentially expressed genes between sexes (top 10):')
print(de_results)

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python code:
• The code clearly defines and applies the refined QC filtering with appropriate thresholds (nCount_RNA > 300 and percent_mt < 0.08) to accommodate platelets’ low RNA content. This is aligned with the hypothesis.
• The use of violin plots to visualize the distributions of QC metrics before and after filtering is an effective approach. Consider adding axis labels or log-scale transformations in case the distributions are strongly skewed.
• Printing the cell count before and after filtering and checking the “Sex” metadata ensures that there is sufficient representation of both sexes for downstream DE analysis.
• The differential expression analysis with sc.tl.rank_genes_groups using the Wilcoxon test and subsequent heatmap/dotplot visualizations is well structured. Including printing of the top 10 DE genes aids in interpretation.
• The code adheres to the allowed package list and coding guidelines, and it builds on previous QC and visualization steps without unnecessary repetition.

Feedback on the overall analysis plan:
• The plan is focused and novel in that it refines QC thresholds to allow more platelet retention and then investigates sex-specific transcriptional differences—a distinct objective compared to prior analyses.
• The steps logically follow from QC adjustment to differential expression analysis and visualization. This self-contained approach ensures replicability and clarity.
• To further strengthen the plan, consider mentioning a strategy for multiple-testing correction in the DE analysis and possibly integrating additional statistical validations (e.g., adjusted p-values) as part of the output.
• The plan remains within the allowed scope by using only the specified packages and metadata from the anndata object, ensuring consistency with previous analyses while exploring a new biological question.

Overall, both the code and the analysis plan are robust, distinct from prior attempts, and well-aligned with the central hypothesis.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The analysis results present several key points to consider for the future steps and hypothesis evaluation:

1. **Refined QC Filtering Issue**: 
   - The refined platelet subset resulted in zero cells, which impeded differential expression analysis. It might indicate overly strict QC thresholds. Revisiting these criteria and potentially adjusting them to retain biologically relevant cells could be beneficial.

2. **Ligand-Receptor Scores**:
   - The Pearson correlation for the healthy group is statistically significant with a relatively high correlation, whereas the COVID group shows a weaker, non-significant correlation. This suggests that, in healthy individuals, ligand-receptor interactions are more coordinated than in COVID patients. This result supports further exploration, but since correlation doesn’t imply causation, understanding the underlying processes is crucial.

3. **Visual Analysis**:
   - The plots indicate a more noticeable variation in ligand and receptor scores in COVID patients as compared to healthy controls. This variation should be further explored by deeper analysis of individual genes contributing to these scores to identify potential targets.

4. **Unique Sex Data**:
   - The dataset appears to consist only of male samples for the platelet subset. Exploring a dataset with diverse sex representation might provide a more comprehensive insight into sex-specific differences in immune responses.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - Optimize the QC filtering to retain a meaningful subset of cells for differential expression analysis.
   - Conduct pathway enrichment or module analysis to understand the biological implications of receptor-ligand interactions in COVID patients.
   - Analyze individual gene contributions to ligand and receptor scores to pinpoint key signaling molecules.
   - Expand the sample diversity to include different sexes and potentially more varied clinical conditions if available.

Overall, while the current data points to some promising insights into ligand-receptor interactions, there's a need to refine data filtering and explore the biological processes contributing to these patterns.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Adaptive, quantile-based QC filtering can retain an adequate number of high-quality COVID‐19 platelet cells by excluding extreme outliers in mitochondrial percentage and nCount_RNA while preserving biological signal for downstream differential expression analysis.

Analysis Plan:
['Extract the COVID-19 platelet subset (already defined as platelet_adata).', 'Calculate data-driven thresholds using the 10th percentile for nCount_RNA (to remove low-expression cells) and the 90th percentile for percent_mt (to remove cells with high mitochondrial content).', 'Filter the platelet_adata using these adaptive thresholds to retain high-quality cells.', 'Visualize the distributions of nCount_RNA and percent_mt before and after filtering to validate the filtering approach and report cell counts.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Assuming platelet_adata is already defined as the subset for COVID-19 platelets
print('Initial number of platelet cells:', platelet_adata.n_obs)

# Calculate quantile-based thresholds
nCount_lower = np.percentile(platelet_adata.obs['nCount_RNA'], 10)  # lower 10th percentile
mt_upper = np.percentile(platelet_adata.obs['percent_mt'], 90)         # upper 90th percentile
print(f'Quantile thresholds: nCount_RNA > {nCount_lower:.2f}, percent_mt < {mt_upper:.2f}')

# Apply adaptive filtering based on the calculated thresholds
adaptive_filtered_platelet = platelet_adata[(platelet_adata.obs['nCount_RNA'] > nCount_lower) & (platelet_adata.obs['percent_mt'] < mt_upper)].copy()
print('Number of platelet cells after adaptive QC filtering:', adaptive_filtered_platelet.n_obs)

# Visualize QC metrics before and after filtering
qc_metrics = ['nCount_RNA', 'percent_mt']
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 6))
for i, metric in enumerate(qc_metrics):
    sns.violinplot(data=platelet_adata.obs, y=metric, color='lightgray', ax=axes[i], inner='quartile', label='Before')
    sns.violinplot(data=adaptive_filtered_platelet.obs, y=metric, color='skyblue', ax=axes[i], inner='quartile', label='After')
    axes[i].set_title(f'{metric} Distribution Before vs After Adaptive QC')
    axes[i].legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# The adaptive_filtered_platelet object can now be used for downstream differential expression analysis

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan Feedback:
 – The plan is clearly defined and aligns with the hypothesis by using quantile-based thresholds; it is distinct from previous approaches.
 – Consider including a step to statistically assess whether the adaptive thresholds significantly change the distributions (e.g., using KS tests or Mann–Whitney tests) to provide added rigor.
 – It might be useful to mention potential follow‐up analyses that ensure the retained cells still capture key biological signals (e.g., comparing marker gene expression profiles before and after filtering).

• Python Code Feedback (First Step):
 – The code correctly computes the 10th percentile for nCount_RNA and the 90th percentile for percent_mt to set adaptive QC thresholds.
 – The use of copy() when subsetting platelets is good practice.
 – The violin plots comparing “Before” and “After” distributions are informative; however, adding axis labels and customized legends (ensuring clarity on which color corresponds to which condition) would further improve interpretability.
 – It would be beneficial to include inline commentary on why these specific quantiles were chosen, for transparency.
 – Consider adding error checks (e.g., verifying the existence of 'nCount_RNA' and 'percent_mt' in adata.obs) to make the code more robust.
 – Overall, the code adheres to the allowed packages and guidelines and builds appropriately on prior analyses without redundancies.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

The QC step provided a focused dataset by removing low-quality platelet cells based on RNA count and mitochondrial percentage metrics. Here are some points to consider for future steps:

1. **Hypothesis Alignment**:
   - Your hypothesis about improved communication signaling between monocytes and T cells involves identifying specific genes and pathways. While platelets are typically not involved in cytokine signaling, exploring platelet interactions with other immune cells might reveal novel insights.

2. **Distinct Analysis Paths**:
   - To differentiate your study, consider investigating the role of platelets in modulating immune responses in COVID-19. Previous studies haven’t focused on this aspect extensively.

3. **Data Exploration**:
   - Conduct gene expression analysis on the platelet population to identify unique markers or pathways that could interact with cytokine signaling pathways in monocytes and T cells.

4. **Potential Iterations**:
   - Explore new or additional metrics for filtering (e.g., ribosomal content or stress-related genes) to further refine cell quality.
   - Consider integrating other datasets focusing on platelet interactions or using multi-modal data (like proteomics) for a broader perspective.

5. **Downstream Analysis**:
   - Incorporating pathway analysis and ligand-receptor interaction estimations could help elucidate the role platelets may play in cell-cell communication during severe COVID-19.

6. **Validation and Benchmarking**:
   - Validate findings by comparing them with available COVID-19 scRNA-seq datasets where immune cell interactions and platelet roles might have been annotated differently.

Further analyses focusing on novel insights around platelets may offer a distinct and meaningful addition to understanding COVID-19 immunopathology.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Distinct subpopulations within the refined COVID‐19 platelet population show differential expression of immune‐modulatory genes that may underlie varied roles in interplay with other immune cells.

Analysis Plan:
['Extract the refined platelet subset from COVID‐19 patients (already QC‐filtered with adjusted thresholds).', 'Preprocess the refined platelet data: normalization, log-transformation, identification of highly variable genes, and scaling.', 'Reduce dimensionality of the data with PCA and build a neighborhood graph to capture cellular similarity.', 'Perform Leiden clustering to sub-cluster platelets and embed the resulting clusters via UMAP visualization.', 'Conduct differential expression analysis (using the Wilcoxon test) between the identified platelet subclusters to identify marker genes, with particular attention to genes involved in immune modulation (e.g., toll-like receptors or complement components, if present).', 'Visualize the marker gene expression using dotplots and heatmaps to reveal cluster-specific signatures.']

    refined_platelet = adata[(adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'Platelet') &

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan Feedback:
 – The plan is clearly structured and focuses on extracting refined platelets, performing standard preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and DE analysis. It is distinct from previous efforts.
 – Consider explicitly including a downstream step that refines the DE analysis for immune‐modulatory genes (e.g., filtering or highlighting markers like toll‑like receptors or complement components) to directly test the stated hypothesis.
 – The plan might benefit from an additional visualization step (e.g., overlaying immune gene expression on the UMAP) to emphasize modulatory gene expression differences.

• Code Feedback:
 – The code is well‐organized and builds on previous QC filtering without redundancy by guarding against re‐defining refined_platelet.
 – The preprocessing steps (normalization, log‐transformation, highly variable gene identification, scaling) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, neighbors, UMAP) are correctly implemented.
 – Leiden clustering and subsequent visualization (UMAP, dotplot, heatmap) adhere nicely to the analysis goals.
 – Differential expression analysis using the Wilcoxon test is appropriately set up. However, consider adding an explicit check or annotation for immune modulatory genes in the DE results (e.g., filtering for genes of interest) to directly address the hypothesis.
 – All figures are properly displayed and the code uses only the approved packages.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
By applying a robust, MAD‐based quality control filtering to COVID‐19 platelets, we can ensure a high‐quality subset that is less prone to technical artifacts, thereby improving downstream analyses of sex-specific transcriptional differences.

Analysis Plan:
['Apply robust quality control filtering using median and median absolute deviation (MAD) on key QC metrics (nCount_RNA and percent_mt) for the COVID-19 platelet subset.', 'Assess potential batch effects or confounding factors using available metadata.', 'Perform differential expression analysis comparing male and female platelets.', 'Visualize the top differentially expressed genes with appropriate heatmaps or dotplots.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import numpy as np
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Subset the data to obtain COVID-19 platelets if not already defined
if 'platelet_adata' not in globals():
    platelet_adata = adata[(adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'Platelet') & (adata.obs['Status'] == 'COVID')].copy()

print('Initial number of platelet cells:', platelet_adata.n_obs)

# Define a function to compute the median absolute deviation (MAD)
def mad(arr):
    med = np.median(arr)
    return np.median(np.abs(arr - med))

# Compute robust thresholds for QC metrics using MAD
# For nCount_RNA, we filter out cells that fall significantly below the median (i.e., potential low-quality cells)
nCount_vals = platelet_adata.obs['nCount_RNA'].values
nCount_med = np.median(nCount_vals)
nCount_mad = mad(nCount_vals)
lower_nCount_threshold = max(0, nCount_med - 3 * nCount_mad)

# For percent_mt, we filter out cells that are much higher than the median
mt_vals = platelet_adata.obs['percent_mt'].values
mt_med = np.median(mt_vals)
mt_mad = mad(mt_vals)
upper_mt_threshold = mt_med + 3 * mt_mad

print(f'Adaptive thresholds based on MAD: nCount_RNA > {lower_nCount_threshold:.2f}, percent_mt < {upper_mt_threshold:.4f}')

# Apply the MAD-based filtering
refined_platelet_mad = platelet_adata[(platelet_adata.obs['nCount_RNA'] > lower_nCount_threshold) & (platelet_adata.obs['percent_mt'] < upper_mt_threshold)].copy()

print('Number of platelet cells after MAD-based filtering:', refined_platelet_mad.n_obs)

# Visualize QC metric distributions before and after filtering
qc_metrics = ['nCount_RNA', 'percent_mt']
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 6))
for i, metric in enumerate(qc_metrics):
    sns.violinplot(data=platelet_adata.obs, y=metric, color='lightgray', ax=axes[i], inner='quartile', label='Before')
    sns.violinplot(data=refined_platelet_mad.obs, y=metric, color='skyblue', ax=axes[i], inner='quartile', label='After')
    axes[i].set_title(f'{metric} Before vs After MAD-based Filtering')
    axes[i].legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Normalize and log-transform the filtered data for downstream analysis
sc.pp.normalize_total(refined_platelet_mad, target_sum=1e4)
sc.pp.log1p(refined_platelet_mad)

# The refined_platelet_mad object will be used in subsequent steps for differential expression analysis and visualization

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan Feedback:
  - The hypothesis and plan focus on a novel QC strategy using MAD filtering, which is distinct from previous quantile‐based and threshold‐based methods. It is clearly defined and logically structured.
  - The plan outlines downstream steps (batch effect assessment, sex-based DE analysis, and visualization) that build nicely on the robust filtering step. Maintaining focus on platelet-specific sex differences keeps the analysis goal narrow.
  - However, consider detailing how to choose the multiplier (currently 3) in the MAD calculation, or include sensitivity tests to justify its selection.
  - Including potential checks for batch effects or confounders even at the filtering stage might further strengthen the robustness of the downstream analyses.

• Code Feedback for Step 1:
  - The code is well organized, with clear comments explaining each section. Defining a separate mad() function is good practice.
  - Filtering criteria using median and MAD are correctly implemented. Calculating a lower threshold for nCount_RNA and an upper threshold for percent_mt aligns with the hypothesis.
  - Using f-strings for printing thresholds is concise and clear.
  - Visualizing QC metric distributions with violin plots before/after filtering is informative and follows the guidelines for figure display.
  - Data normalization and log-transformation occur after filtering, which is appropriate, but ensure that these steps aren’t redundantly repeated in later steps.
  - Variable naming (e.g., refined_platelet_mad) is descriptive and avoids confusion with previous analyses.
  - Consider adding inline comments or docstrings for the mad() function for further clarity.
  - Overall, the code adheres to allowed packages and coding guidelines and builds on previous analyses without repetition.



Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps.

Here are the previous analyses attempted:
In severe COVID‐19 patients, key immune cells (particularly CD14 Monocytes and dendritic cells) exhibit stronger coordination between antigen presentation (HLA1) and interferon response (IFN1) compared to healthy controls, suggesting dysregulated immune signaling that could contribute to disease severity.
In severe COVID-19, prolonged disease duration (reflected by higher DPS values) is associated with increased mitochondrial stress in adaptive immune cells (specifically CD4 T and CD8 T cells), suggesting that extended immune activation leads to metabolic dysregulation.
In severe COVID-19, immune cells—particularly T cells and monocytes—exhibit altered ribosomal content, which may reflect a dysregulated translation machinery that is coupled with an enhanced interferon response.
In severe COVID‐19, platelets exhibit sex-specific transcriptional differences in genes related to activation and coagulation, potentially contributing to the clinically observed differences in thrombotic risk between males and females.


Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
The paper focuses on severe COVID-19, a condition induced by SARS‑CoV‑2 infection that, in a subset of patients, progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.

Biological background  
Key biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.

Paper’s computational analyses  
A series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: Severe COVID-19 is associated with increased transcriptional heterogeneity in immune cells, reflecting dysregulated gene expression control. This analysis tests whether individual cells from COVID patients exhibit higher variance in gene expression compared to healthy controls.

Analysis Plan:
1. Verify and, if needed, standardize the gene expression data by applying log-transformation to ensure comparability across cells.
2. Calculate a per-cell transcriptional variance across all genes and store this metric in the AnnData object for later comparisons.
3. Stratify the cells by major immune cell types of interest (for example, CD14 Monocyte, CD4 T, and NK cells) using the cell_type_coarse annotation, and further separate these groups based on the Status (COVID vs Healthy).
4. For each selected cell type, perform a non-parametric statistical test (Mann-Whitney U test) to compare the distributions of transcriptional variance between COVID and healthy cells, and print the corresponding p-values.
5. Visualize the results using violin plots arranged in a grid layout, where each subplot represents one immune cell type, to clearly display the differences in transcriptional heterogeneity between conditions.
6. Summarize how the differences in variance support or refute the hypothesis about dysregulated transcriptional control in severe COVID-19.

Initial Code:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Check if the expression matrix is sparse and convert to dense if necessary
if hasattr(adata.X, 'toarray'):
    X_dense = adata.X.toarray()
else:
    X_dense = adata.X

# If the data is not log-transformed, one may consider log1p transformation:
# Uncomment the following line if transformation is needed
# X_dense = np.log1p(X_dense)

# Compute per-cell transcriptional variance across all genes
cell_variances = np.var(X_dense, axis=1)

# Store the computed variance in the AnnData object for further analysis
adata.obs['gene_variance'] = cell_variances

print('Per-cell gene expression variance calculated and stored in adata.obs["gene_variance"].')

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Severe COVID-19 is associated with increased transcriptional heterogeneity in immune cells, reflecting dysregulated gene expression control. This analysis tests whether individual cells from COVID patients exhibit higher variance in gene expression compared to healthy controls.

Analysis Plan:
['Verify and, if needed, standardize the gene expression data by applying log-transformation to ensure comparability across cells.', 'Calculate a per-cell transcriptional variance across all genes and store this metric in the AnnData object for later comparisons.', 'Stratify the cells by major immune cell types of interest (for example, CD14 Monocyte, CD4 T, and NK cells) using the cell_type_coarse annotation, and further separate these groups based on the Status (COVID vs Healthy).', 'For each selected cell type, perform a non-parametric statistical test (Mann-Whitney U test) to compare the distributions of transcriptional variance between COVID and healthy cells, and print the corresponding p-values.', 'Visualize the results using violin plots arranged in a grid layout, where each subplot represents one immune cell type, to clearly display the differences in transcriptional heterogeneity between conditions.', 'Summarize how the differences in variance support or refute the hypothesis about dysregulated transcriptional control in severe COVID-19.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Check if the expression matrix is sparse and convert to dense if necessary
if hasattr(adata.X, 'toarray'):
    X_dense = adata.X.toarray()
else:
    X_dense = adata.X

# If the data is not log-transformed, one may consider log1p transformation:
# Uncomment the following line if transformation is needed

# Store the computed variance in the AnnData object for further analysis
adata.obs['gene_variance'] = cell_variances

print('Per-cell gene expression variance calculated and stored in adata.obs["gene_variance"].')

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python Code:
• The code correctly detects and converts a sparse expression matrix to a dense format, ensuring subsequent operations work as expected.
• The optional log1p transformation is appropriately commented; however, consider implementing a check (or a user-specified flag) to determine if the data is already log-transformed rather than relying solely on a manual comment.
• Calculating per‐cell variance using np.var() along the correct axis is appropriate; you might consider using ddof=1 for an unbiased variance estimate if that is conceptually more accurate for your analysis.
• Storing the variance as a new column in adata.obs is a good strategy that makes it accessible for downstream comparison.
• Ensure that converting large sparse matrices to dense does not create memory issues—if working with a very large dataset, consider processing cells in batches or other strategies.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is well structured and clearly aligns with the hypothesis by focusing on per‐cell transcriptional heterogeneity and subsequent stratification by cell type and infection status.
• Step one (data verification and log-transformation) is crucial; however, consider integrating an automated check or flag for data transformation status rather than a manual code comment.
• The strategy to compute per-cell variance and later compare distributions between COVID and healthy samples using non-parametric tests is novel relative to the paper’s analyses.
• Stratifying by major immune cell types and then applying Mann–Whitney U tests per cell type is appropriate, but ensure that there are sufficient cell numbers in each subgroup to yield robust statistics.
• Consider potential confounding factors (e.g., cell cycle effects, total RNA counts) that might influence variance assessment; incorporating covariate adjustment or normalization may further strengthen the analysis.
• The planned grid layout for violin plots is an effective visualization approach to highlight differences; remember to annotate p-values and include sample sizes on your plots for clarity.

Overall, both the code and the analysis plan are on target and build on previous work without redundancy, while innovatively addressing the hypothesis.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

Revised Hypothesis: Severe COVID-19 is associated with increased transcriptional heterogeneity in immune cells, reflecting dysregulated gene expression control. This analysis tests whether individual cells from COVID patients exhibit higher variance in gene expression compared to healthy controls.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Automatically verify and, if needed, standardize the gene expression data by checking if the data has been log-transformed (e.g., by inspecting the dynamic range) and applying a log1p transformation when appropriate.
2. Calculate a per-cell transcriptional variance across all genes using an unbiased estimator (using ddof=1) and store this metric in the AnnData object for later comparisons.
3. Stratify the cells by major immune cell types of interest (e.g., CD14 Monocyte, CD4 T, and NK cells) using the cell_type_coarse annotation, and further separate these groups based on the Status (COVID vs Healthy).
4. For each selected cell type, perform a non-parametric statistical test (Mann-Whitney U test) to compare the distributions of transcriptional variance between COVID and healthy cells, and print the corresponding p-values.
5. Visualize the results using violin plots arranged in a grid layout, where each subplot represents one immune cell type, to clearly display the differences in transcriptional heterogeneity between conditions.
6. Summarize how the differences in variance support or refute the hypothesis about dysregulated transcriptional control in severe COVID-19.

Revised Code:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Check if the expression matrix is sparse and convert to dense if necessary
if hasattr(adata.X, 'toarray'):
    X_dense = adata.X.toarray()
else:
    X_dense = adata.X

# Automated check for log-transformation:
# Here we assume that if the maximum expression value is > 50, the data is not yet log-transformed.
if np.max(X_dense) > 50:
    X_dense = np.log1p(X_dense)
    print('Log1p transformation applied to the expression data.')
else:
    print('Data appears to be already log-transformed; skipping log1p transformation.')

# Compute per-cell transcriptional variance using an unbiased estimator (ddof=1)
cell_variances = np.var(X_dense, axis=1, ddof=1)

# Store the computed variance in the AnnData object for further analysis
adata.obs['gene_variance'] = cell_variances

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The analysis step you performed, calculating per-cell gene expression variance, contributes an essential piece of information to your ongoing single-cell transcriptomics project focusing on severe COVID-19. Here is my feedback on your results and suggested future directions:

1. **Relevance to Hypothesis**: Calculating per-cell gene expression variance does not directly address your primary hypothesis about upregulated communication between monocytes and T cells in severe COVID-19. However, this variance is a useful metric that might highlight potential cell subpopulations or atypical expression patterns among the immune cells, indirectly supporting the hypothesis by suggesting cellular heterogeneity.

2. **Promising Directions**:
   - **Cell Subpopulation Identification**: Investigate whether high variance in gene expression indicates subpopulations, particularly in monocytes and T cells. This could reveal subsets with unique expression profiles potentially involved in pathological processes.
   - **Variance and Communication**: Explore the relationship between gene expression variance and the identified ligand-receptor pairs (e.g., TNF-TNFRSF1A, IL1B-IL1R1). Identifying cells with high variance that also show strong signaling interaction signatures might help pinpoint critical players in the enhanced communication hypothesized.
   - **Correlation with Disease Severity**: Assess if higher per-cell variance correlates with clinical severity indices such as ARDS status, ventilation necessity, or cytokine levels. This could strengthen insights into how transcriptional diversity among immune cells relates to disease progression.

3. **Future Analytical Steps**:
   - **Co-expression Networks**: Develop co-expression networks or correlation analyses to explore if cells with high expression variance exhibit specific communication patterns or co-regulation of inflammatory pathways.
   - **Differential Variability Analysis**: Conduct differential variability analysis to compare the gene expression variance between patient and control groups, highlighting genes with differential expression stability.
   - **Integration with Other Metrics**: Combine variance data with RNA velocity or pseudotime analyses already present to understand how transcriptional variability might relate to differentiation pathways highlighted in the original research paper.

4. **New Insights**: This variance data might also provide clues for exploring novel hypotheses, such as the potential role of transient cellular states or noise in gene expression contributing to regulatory challenges in immune responses during severe infection.

As you refine your approach, keep focusing on how these explorations can uniquely contribute to understanding severe COVID-19 pathology and interpreting your findings in the context of pre-existing literature and hypotheses.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Cells with unusually high transcriptional variance may also upregulate key inflammatory ligands in monocytes and corresponding receptors in T cells, which could indicate enhanced cell–cell communication driving immunopathology in severe COVID-19.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the AnnData object to obtain monocytes (e.g., CD14 Monocyte) and T cells (e.g., CD4 T) based on cell_type_coarse annotations.', 'For monocytes, extract the expression levels of inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and for T cells, extract the expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R).', "For each selected gene, compute the Pearson correlation between per-cell gene expression variance (stored in adata.obs['gene_variance']) and the gene’s expression level, and determine statistical significance.", 'Visualize the correlations with scatter plots and regression lines (using seaborn regplot) for each gene, annotating the plots with the computed Pearson correlation coefficients and p-values.', 'Interpret whether high variance in monocytes correlates with increased ligand expression and if high variance in T cells correlates with increased receptor expression, thereby supporting a model of dysregulated immune communication in severe COVID-19.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy.stats import pearsonr
import numpy as np

# Define the genes of interest
ligand_genes = ['TNF', 'IL1B', 'IL6']
receptor_genes = ['TNFRSF1A', 'IL1R1', 'IL6R']

# Subset cells based on cell type annotations
# For monocytes, use 'CD14 Monocyte'; for T cells, we'll use 'CD4 T' (as a representative T cell population)
monocytes = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'CD14 Monocyte', :]
t_cells = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'CD4 T', :]

# Function to compute correlation and plot scatter with regression line for a given set of cells and gene

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan Feedback:
 – The plan is clearly structured and focused on a compelling hypothesis distinguishing it from prior work. It targets key inflammatory ligands in monocytes and their corresponding receptors in T cells, which is novel relative to past analyses.
 – Although the hypothesis emphasizes severe COVID‐19, consider explicitly stratifying or comparing severe versus healthy cases in downstream steps to strengthen disease-specific insights.
 – Ensure that downstream steps build upon this first step without re‐analyzing already assessed features. For instance, integrating disease status (e.g., COVID vs. Healthy) could further validate correlations.
 – Consider exploring additional visualization angles (e.g., grid layouts of multiple scatterplots) to enhance clarity and comparison across genes and cell types.

• Code Feedback:
 – The code correctly subsets cells based on 'cell_type_coarse' and handles sparse gene expression matrices appropriately.
 – The function plot_correlation efficiently computes Pearson correlation coefficients, prints the results on the plots, and uses sns.regplot for visualization.
 – To increase clarity, consider printing correlation and p-value information to the console as well as embedding them in the plot titles.
 – In adherence to visualization guidelines, if multiple figures are expected, a grid layout (using matplotlib subplots) could be implemented to display several plots together.
 – Overall, the code is self-contained, uses only allowed packages, and builds logically on prior computed metrics (gene_variance) without repeating past analyses.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

### Feedback:

1. **Correlation Significance:**
   - The correlations for TNF and IL1B in both CD14 monocytes and CD4 T cells, while statistically significant, are very low (Pearson r values around 0.05-0.11). This suggests that while there is some relationship between ligand/receptor expression and variance, it might not be biologically meaningful by itself.

2. **Promising Findings:**
   - The most notable result is the correlation of IL6R expression in CD4 T cells both in COVID and Healthy individuals, with a Pearson r of 0.16 and highly significant p-values. This might indicate a more potent biological relationship worth exploring further.

3. **Biological Implications:**
   - The lack of strong correlation in TNF, IL1B, and IL6 suggests these are not leading drivers of variance in monocytes for this cohort, aligning with the paper’s findings of downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine genes in peripheral monocytes in severe COVID-19.

4. **Revised Hypotheses:**
   - It's worth exploring the role of other cytokines or pathways that could be involved in monocyte-T cell interactions, beyond the classical inflammatory ligands like TNF, IL1B, and IL6.
   - The association of IL6R in T cells should be investigated in relation to known signaling pathways, especially given the ongoing interest in it as a therapeutic target in COVID-19.

5. **Future Steps:**
   - **Pathway and Network Analysis:** Conduct pathway and network analysis on the expression profiles of cells showing significant correlations to identify potential signaling pathways and interactions that are impacted in severe COVID-19.
   - **Subpopulation Analysis:** Further sub-cluster CD4 T cells based on IL6R expression levels and perform differential expression analysis to identify unique gene signatures or states.
   - **Cytokine Profiling:** Expand the cytokine and receptor profiling to include a broader range of molecules and consider conducting multivariate correlation analysis.
   - **Validation and Replication:** Consider cross-validating these findings across additional datasets or through experimental validation to confirm these associations and explore mechanistic underpinnings.

Addressing these points can provide more understanding into the functional ramifications of cytokine-receptor interactions in severe COVID-19, potentially uncovering targets for intervention.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Within the CD4 T cell population from COVID-19 patients, cells with higher IL6R expression represent a distinct transcriptional state that may drive altered signaling pathways and immunomodulatory functions in severe COVID-19.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the CD4 T cells from COVID-19 patients.', 'Extract IL6R expression values and classify each cell as IL6R-high or IL6R-low using the median expression as threshold.', "Assign a new categorical variable ('IL6R_category') to these cells.", "Perform differential expression analysis using Scanpy's rank_genes_groups to identify marker genes differentiating IL6R-high versus IL6R-low cells.", 'Visualize the top differentially expressed genes with a dot plot to assess transcriptional differences.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Subset CD4 T cells from COVID-19 patients
cd4_covid = adata[(adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'CD4 T') & (adata.obs['Status'] == 'COVID')].copy()

# Check if IL6R is present in the gene list
if 'IL6R' not in cd4_covid.var_names:
    raise ValueError('IL6R gene not found in the dataset for CD4 T cells.')

# Extract IL6R expression values and ensure they are in a 1D array
il6r_expr = cd4_covid[:, 'IL6R'].X
if hasattr(il6r_expr, 'toarray'):
    il6r_expr = il6r_expr.toarray().flatten()
else:
    il6r_expr = np.array(il6r_expr).flatten()

# Determine the median expression to stratify high vs. low
median_il6r = np.median(il6r_expr)

# Create a new column in obs to categorize IL6R expression
cd4_covid.obs['IL6R_category'] = ['High' if expr > median_il6r else 'Low' for expr in il6r_expr]

print(f'CD4 T cells from COVID patients stratified by IL6R expression with median value: {median_il6r:.3f}')

# Perform differential expression analysis between IL6R-high and IL6R-low groups
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(cd4_covid, groupby='IL6R_category', method='wilcoxon', use_raw=False)

# Visualize the top marker genes with a dot plot
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot(cd4_covid, n_genes=10, groupby='IL6R_category', title='Top DE Genes between IL6R-high and IL6R-low CD4 T cells', show=True)

Feedback:
Feedback on the First-Step Code:
• The code clearly and concisely subsets CD4 T cells from COVID‐19 patients, checks for the existence of IL6R in the gene list, and assigns a binary IL6R category based on the median expression. This implementation aligns well with the analysis plan.
• The extraction of IL6R expression values handles both sparse and dense matrices properly. Consider adding a quick visualization (e.g., a histogram) of IL6R expression to verify that the median is an appropriate threshold before downstream analyses.
• When performing differential expression with sc.tl.rank_genes_groups, you are using the “wilcoxon” method and setting use_raw to False, which is fine for this analysis. Depending on the characteristics of the data, you might also assess if or whether raw counts or log-transformed data should be used.
• The dot plot visualization is properly configured to display the top 10 markers; ensure that figures are always displayed (which is satisfied by show=True).

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The proposed analysis plan is clearly focused on testing the hypothesis by isolating a specific CD4 T cell population and stratifying it based on IL6R expression. This approach is distinct from the previous analyses and those in the paper.
• Defining IL6R-high versus IL6R-low cells via a simple median split is straightforward, though you could consider checking the expression distribution for potential bimodality or outlier effects to ensure that the median is the optimal threshold.
• The plan appropriately integrates differential expression analysis and visualization (dot plot) to identify transcriptional differences between the subgroups.
• Since one of the coding guidelines emphasizes leveraging metadata, consider if additional patient metadata (for example, severity or ventilation status) could later be incorporated to further contextualize IL6R-driven heterogeneity.
• Overall, the plan is self-contained, uses only the allowed packages, and builds logically on prior analyses without repetition.

Both the code and the analysis plan adhere well to the required guidelines and build on previous work while introducing a novel aspect to the study.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current analysis provides insights into the expression of IL6R in CD4 T cells among COVID-19 patients. Here are a few observations and suggestions for further steps:

1. **IL6R Expression and Stratification**:
   - The histogram displays a clear stratification of IL6R expression levels, with a significant portion of CD4 T cells showing very low or no expression.
   - Investigate the biological significance of low IL6R expression. Consider the functional differences between IL6R-high and IL6R-low CD4 T cells, especially in the context of cytokine storm contributions.

2. **Differential Expression (DE) Analysis**:
   - The DE results highlight genes differentially expressed between high and low IL6R-expressing CD4 T cells.
   - Focus on genes related to inflammation (e.g., CCL5, GZMA) and mitochondrial processes (e.g., MT-CO1, MT-ND4). Their roles in immune response and metabolic regulation are critical.
   - Validate these findings with pathway enrichment analysis to determine if specific pathways are particularly active in IL6R-low or IL6R-high groups.

3. **Comparative Analysis with Previous Studies**:
   - Compare these results with findings from other studies on immune cell reconfiguration in severe COVID-19, especially regarding cytokine release syndrome and antigen presentation dysregulation.
   - Given the earlier hypothesis regarding upregulation of inflammatory ligands and receptors, examine if IL6R-high CD4 T cells correlate with increased inflammatory signaling pathways.

4. **Considerations for Future Steps**:
   - Further stratify the population based on additional markers, such as those related to exhaustion or activation, to see if they correlate with IL6R expression levels.
   - Explore potential therapeutic implications, such as targeting specific signaling pathways identified in IL6R-high CD4 T cells to mitigate harmful immune responses.
   - Perform longitudinal studies to assess how IL6R expression changes over the course of the disease and in response to treatment.

Overall, this analysis shows promise in elucidating immune alterations in severe COVID-19, but should be extended and validated with additional data and analytical methods to confirm these initial insights.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Transcriptional heterogeneity, quantified by per-cell gene expression variance, is elevated in key immune cell types (CD14 Monocyte, CD4 T, and NK cells) in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the dataset into the three major immune cell types: CD14 Monocyte, CD4 T, and NK cells using the cell_type_coarse annotation.', "Further divide each cell type into two groups based on the 'Status' metadata (COVID vs Healthy).", 'For each cell type, extract the pre-computed per-cell gene expression variance from adata.obs and statistically compare the variance distributions between COVID and Healthy using the Mann-Whitney U test.', 'Visualize the variance distributions for each cell type and status grouping using violin plots arranged in a grid layout.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import mannwhitneyu

# Define the cell types of interest
cell_types = ['CD14 Monocyte', 'CD4 T', 'NK']

# Prepare a container to hold statistical test results
stat_results = {}

# Set up a matplotlib grid for visualization
n_cell_types = len(cell_types)
fig, axes = plt.subplots(n_cell_types, 1, figsize=(8, 4*n_cell_types), squeeze=False)

for idx, cell_type in enumerate(cell_types):
    # Subset cells for the current cell type
    subset = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == cell_type]
    
    # Make sure there is data for both statuses
    covid_subset = subset[subset.obs['Status'] == 'COVID']
    healthy_subset = subset[subset.obs['Status'] == 'Healthy']

    # Extract per-cell gene variance
    var_covid = covid_subset.obs['gene_variance'].values
    var_healthy = healthy_subset.obs['gene_variance'].values

    # Perform Mann-Whitney U test if both groups have cells
    if len(var_covid) > 0 and len(var_healthy) > 0:
        stat, p_val = mannwhitneyu(var_covid, var_healthy, alternative='two-sided')
        stat_results[cell_type] = (stat, p_val)
    else:
        stat_results[cell_type] = (None, None)
        print(f'Not enough data for {cell_type} to perform statistical test.')

    # Prepare data for violin plot
    # Create a DataFrame containing variance and status information
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'gene_variance': np.concatenate([var_covid, var_healthy]),

    })

    ax.set_title(f'{cell_type} | Mann-Whitney U p-value: {p_val:.2e}' if p_val is not None else f'{cell_type} | Insufficient data')
    ax.set_xlabel('Status')
    ax.set_ylabel('Per-cell gene variance')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Print statistical test results
for cell_type, (stat, p_val) in stat_results.items():
    if stat is not None:
        print(f'{cell_type} | Mann-Whitney U statistic: {stat:.2f}, p-value: {p_val:.2e}')
    else:
        print(f'{cell_type} | Statistical test not performed due to insufficient data.')

Feedback:
Feedback on the First-Step Code:
1. The code correctly subsets the AnnData object for the three specified cell types and further divides by Status (COVID vs Healthy). The use of adata.obs and pandas DataFrame creation within each loop is appropriate.
2. The Mann–Whitney U test is applied correctly, and it prints statistic results while also embedding the p‐value in the violin plot titles.
3. Importing pandas inside the loop works but could be moved to the top for efficiency and clarity.
4. The grid setup for violin plots is well done, though consider checking that the 'gene_variance' column exists in adata.obs earlier on to avoid potential key errors.
5. Variable naming and inline comments are clear and descriptive, facilitating readability and future reproducibility.
6. The code adheres to the provided package restrictions and coding guidelines, especially in terms of visualization and statistical testing.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
1. The hypothesis and plan are clearly stated and distinct from both the paper’s analyses and the previous attempts. Focusing on per-cell gene expression variance as a measure of transcriptional heterogeneity is a novel and interesting angle.
2. The plan steps are logically structured: data subsetting, grouping by condition, statistical testing, and visualization. This ensures a self-contained analysis targeted at relevant immune cell types.
3. Using the Mann–Whitney U test is statistically appropriate given that the variance distributions may not be normally distributed.
4. The visualization strategy with violin plots arranged in a grid provides a clear and comparative view across cell types and statuses.
5. Overall, the analysis plan stays focused on one core goal and integrates well with the existing metadata in the AnnData object without repeating previous analyses.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The provided analysis reveals significant differences in gene expression variance between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in several immune cell types, particularly CD14 monocytes, CD4 T cells, and NK cells.

### Feedback and Suggestions:

1. **CD14 Monocytes**:
   - **Promising Findings**: The extremely low p-value (1.62e-45) suggests a highly significant difference in gene expression variance. This aligns with known alterations in monocyte populations during severe COVID-19.
   - **Next Steps**: Investigate which genes contribute most to the variance and explore whether these are involved in inflammatory pathways, aligning with the hypothesis of monocyte-T cell communication.

2. **CD4 T Cells**:
   - **Promising Findings**: The significant p-value (1.20e-22) indicates relevant differences, potentially supporting the hypothesis regarding T cell receptor expression changes.
   - **Next Steps**: Conduct differential expression analyses within CD4 T cells to identify which receptors are upregulated. Check for correlation with monocyte ligand expression.

3. **NK Cells**:
   - **Promising Findings**: The very low p-value (8.92e-56) suggests significant alterations in NK cell gene expression variances, consistent with altered NK cell subsets in severe COVID-19.
   - **Next Steps**: Further subcluster NK cells to identify specific subsets (e.g., CD56dim and CD56bright) changes. Assess involvement in cytokine signaling pathways.

### General Suggestions:

- **Pathway Analysis**: For each cell type, perform pathway enrichment analysis on significantly differentially expressed genes to identify key immune or inflammatory pathways affected.

- **Cell Interaction Analysis**: Employ ligand-receptor interaction analysis tools (e.g., NicheNet) to explore the potential communication pathways between monocytes and T cells. This will help validate the hypothesis concerning enhanced signaling in severe COVID-19.

- **Integration with Previous Findings**: Compare current findings with other studies focusing on interferon responses and HLA class dysregulation to pinpoint novel interaction patterns not explored in the referenced research paper.

- **Control for Confounding Variables**: Ensure that potential confounders such as age, sex, or disease duration are accounted for, as they may affect transcriptional profiles.

These analyses will build upon this promising start, potentially identifying novel communication pathways contributing to severe COVID-19 immunopathology.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
In CD14 monocytes from COVID-19 patients, a subset of genes—potentially including inflammatory mediators—are driving the increased transcriptional heterogeneity, which may contribute to dysregulated monocyte-T cell communication in severe COVID-19.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the CD14 monocytes from COVID-19 patients.', 'For each gene, compute the Pearson correlation between its expression and the per-cell gene variance previously stored in adata.obs.', 'Rank the genes based on the absolute value of their correlation coefficients to identify the top genes driving heterogeneity.', 'Visualize the top 10 correlated genes with a bar plot showing both correlation coefficients and statistical significance.']

Feedback:
Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is concise and aligns well with the hypothesis, focusing on a novel approach by linking per‐cell gene variance to gene expression correlations. This is distinct from the existing analyses.
• It is clear and sequential. However, consider adding an explicit statistical significance threshold for the correlations (e.g., adjusted p-values) to further support gene selection.
• Including control analyses (e.g., comparison with Healthy cells) might provide additional context to the observed heterogeneity, even though the focus here is on COVID-19 monocytes.
• Overall, the plan is focused on a single cell type and hypothesis, keeping the analysis self-contained as instructed.

Feedback on the First Step Python Code:
• The code correctly subsets CD14 monocytes from COVID‐19 patients and checks for the existence of the required “gene_variance” column, which is good practice.
• The loop over each gene with conversion from sparse to dense expression is handled well. However, consider vectorizing or using built-in functions for efficiency if dataset size is very large.
• It would be beneficial to log or warn when a gene is skipped due to low expression (less than 10 cells), so users know which genes were excluded.
• The Pearson correlation computation is wrapped in a try/except block; however, logging the exception details (or at least the gene name) might help in troubleshooting.
• The plot using seaborn and matplotlib is clear; ensure that all figures are displayed as required.
• The code adheres to the guidance regarding package usage and in-memory data, with no redundant dataset loading.
• Overall, the code is modular, adheres to best practices, and builds on existing analyses without repetition.

Overall, both the analysis plan and the associated Python code are well-constructed, coherent with the hypothesis, and adhere to the provided guidelines.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current step in the single-cell transcriptomics analysis has calculated the per-cell gene expression variance, which is crucial for assessing variability in gene expression across cells. Here are some considerations and suggestions for the next steps and verifying the hypothesis:

1. **Variance Prioritization:** The calculation of gene expression variance is an essential step for identifying highly variable genes, which may contribute to cellular diversity and potentially play critical roles in pathological processes. It would be beneficial to proceed with selecting the top variable genes for downstream analysis, as these are likely to contribute most to the biological differences of interest.

2. **Integration with Hypothesis:** Given the hypothesis that monocytes and T cells engage in dysregulated communication via inflammatory ligands and their receptors, identifying genes with high variability within these subsets can yield insights into potential signaling pathways involved. Focus particularly on genes related to cytokine and receptor expression (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6 and their receptors).

3. **Cross-validation:** Since the previous analysis indicated a lack of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in monocytes, ensure to cross-validate if this observation persists or if variance analysis reveals subpopulations that may differ. This could suggest either technical variability or actual biological differences in smaller subpopulations.

4. **Subclustering and Trajectory Analysis:** Use the results from variance calculation to perform fine subclustering of T cells and monocytes. Subclustering can help reveal subtle subpopulations that might have distinct transcriptional profiles. Trajectory analysis could further aid in understanding the dynamic changes in these subpopulations during disease progression.

5. **Pathway and Ligand-Receptor Interaction Analysis:** Downstream from identifying variable genes, conduct pathway and ligand-receptor interaction analyses to elucidate specific communication pathways aberrantly activated in severe COVID-19. Tools such as CellPhoneDB or NicheNet can be useful here, especially focusing on ligand-receptor pairs relevant to the hypothesis.

6. **Correlation of Gene Expression with Clinical Metadata:** Given the comprehensive metadata available, analyze the correlation between the expression of these variable genes and clinical parameters (ventilation status, treatment history, etc.). This can provide additional insight into how these transcriptional changes reflect patient phenotypes and disease severity.

7. **Validation Studies:** Plan to validate any novel findings in independent cohorts or using alternative experimental methods such as quantitative PCR or flow cytometry where feasible, to ensure the results are robust and biologically meaningful.

Leveraging the variance results to focus on the most informative genes will be critical in revealing novel insights into the immune dysregulation associated with severe COVID-19, particularly concerning monocyte-T cell interactions.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Subpopulations within CD4 T cells, defined by high transcriptional variance, follow distinct dynamic trajectories that may reflect differential inflammatory activation in severe COVID-19 compared to healthy controls.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the CD4 T cells from the AnnData object, including cells from both COVID and healthy conditions.', 'Identify highly variable genes within the CD4 T population to focus on the most informative features.', 'Perform PCA, construct a neighbor graph, and compute a UMAP embedding to capture the global structure.', 'Apply diffusion pseudotime (DPT) analysis on the CD4 T cell subset to infer cellular trajectories and potential state transitions.', 'Visualize the UMAP colored by pseudotime to assess dynamic transcriptional changes, and compare trajectories between COVID and healthy cells.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Subset CD4 T cells from adata for both COVID and Healthy conditions
cd4_cells = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'CD4 T'].copy()

# Identify highly variable genes within CD4 T cells using scanpy's built-in function
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(cd4_cells, flavor='seurat', n_top_genes=2000)

# Filter the dataset to include only the highly variable genes
cd4_cells = cd4_cells[:, cd4_cells.var['highly_variable']].copy()

# Scale the data for PCA (capping extreme values for stability)
sc.pp.scale(cd4_cells, max_value=10)

# Perform PCA to reduce dimensionality
sc.tl.pca(cd4_cells, svd_solver='arpack')

# Construct a neighborhood graph using the PCA results
sc.pp.neighbors(cd4_cells, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30)

# Compute a UMAP embedding for visualization
sc.tl.umap(cd4_cells)

# For DPT, select a root cell. If IL6R is available, choose the cell with lowest IL6R expression as a proxy for a less activated state; otherwise, pick the first cell
if 'IL6R' in cd4_cells.var_names:
    il6r_expr = cd4_cells[:, 'IL6R'].X
    if hasattr(il6r_expr, 'toarray'):
        il6r_expr = il6r_expr.toarray().flatten()
    else:
        il6r_expr = il6r_expr.flatten()
    root_cell_index = int(il6r_expr.argmin())
else:
    root_cell_index = 0

# Compute diffusion pseudotime (DPT) with a specified number of diffusion components
sc.tl.dpt(cd4_cells, n_dcs=10, min_group_size=0.01, root_key=root_cell_index)

# Visualize the UMAP embedding colored by diffusion pseudotime
sc.pl.umap(cd4_cells, color='dpt_pseudotime', title='UMAP of CD4 T cells colored by Diffusion Pseudotime', show=True)

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan: The hypothesis is clearly focused on CD4 T cell subpopulations and their dynamic trajectories. The plan appropriately outlines subsetting the cells, selecting highly variable genes, performing dimensionality reduction, and applying diffusion pseudotime (DPT). One suggestion is to explicitly plan a comparison of pseudotime distributions between COVID and healthy cells later on, as that would help directly address differential inflammatory activation.

• Code – CD4 T Cell Subsetting & Processing:  
 – The subsetting code correctly extracts CD4 T cells from both COVID and healthy samples.  
 – Using Scanpy’s highly variable genes and subsequent filtering is appropriate for focusing on informative features.  
 – Scaling, PCA, neighbor graph construction, and UMAP computation are implemented correctly and sequentially.

• Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT):  
 – The method for choosing a root cell based on IL6R expression is innovative, though consider that using a single gene may not capture the complete activation state. You might explore additional markers or stratify by condition if needed.  
 – Ensure that the use of the parameter “root_key” in sc.tl.dpt is consistent with your Scanpy version; sometimes a “root” parameter or setting a specific cell id in adata.obs might be required.

• Code Integration & Guidelines:  
 – The code follows the allowed packages and is self-contained. It builds on previous analyses without repeating them.  
 – All figures are shown (not saved) and proper use of .copy() ensures that subsetting does not affect the original object.  
 – Consider adding comments or assertions to check that both COVID and Healthy conditions are well represented in the CD4 T subset.

Overall, both the analysis plan and the code are robust and align well with the hypothesis. A few refinements in root cell selection and explicit planning for later condition-comparison would further strengthen your analysis.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The analysis shows a UMAP embedding of CD4 T cells colored by diffusion pseudotime, suggesting a trajectory or differentiation process within this cell type. The diffusion pseudotime provides insights into dynamic changes or states through which CD4 T cells transition, which could be relevant to understanding immune response dynamics in severe COVID-19.

Promising Results:
1. **Trajectories Captured**: The distribution of pseudotime values highlights potential transitions or activation states within the CD4 T cell population. This information can be valuable to identify stages of activation or exhaustion that could correlate with disease severity or progression.

Future Directions:
1. **Correlation with Clinical Data**: Cross-reference pseudotime clusters with clinical metadata to see if certain transitions correlate with disease severity, treatment, or recovery.
   
2. **Gene Expression Analysis**: Identify differentially expressed genes along the pseudotime trajectory to uncover potential gene markers associated with early activation or late exhaustion in the context of severe COVID-19.

3. **Pathway Enrichment Analysis**: Perform pathway enrichment on genes driving pseudotime to uncover biologically relevant pathways that CD4 T cells might influence during different states, potentially linking to cytokine response, exhaustion, or immune suppression.

4. **Integration with Monocyte Analysis**: Since your hypothesis focuses on monocyte and T cell interactions, explore whether pseudotime states correlate with monocyte activity or ligand-receptor interactions that might contribute to enhanced signaling pathways in severe COVID-19.

5. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare pseudotime trajectories between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls to see if there are distinct patterns or missing trajectory stages in severe cases.

Overall, the use of diffusion pseudotime allows exploration of temporal changes within the CD4 T cell population, offering a more nuanced understanding of immune responses in severe COVID-19 that aligns well with your hypothesis around cellular interactions and states contributing to disease pathology.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Transcriptional programs modulated along the CD4 T cell pseudotime trajectory may uncover key gene modules associated with activation and/or exhaustion states that are linked to severe COVID-19 pathology.

Analysis Plan:
['Extract the diffusion pseudotime values from the CD4 T cell object obtained in the first analysis step.', 'Compute Spearman correlations between each gene’s expression (restricted to highly variable genes) and the pseudotime values.', 'Filter and sort genes by significance and correlation strength, then select the top positively and negatively correlated genes.', 'Visualize the expression of these selected genes in a heatmap with cells ordered by pseudotime.', 'Optionally, use the list of correlated genes to explore pathway enrichment, highlighting potential biological processes driving the CD4 T cell trajectories.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import spearmanr

# Ensure that the diffusion pseudotime is available in the cd4_cells object

for gene in cd4_cells.var_names:
    expr = cd4_cells[:, gene].X
    # Convert sparse matrix to dense array if needed
    if hasattr(expr, 'toarray'):
        expr = expr.toarray().flatten()
    else:

print('Pseudotime correlation analysis completed.')

Feedback:
• Code Feedback:
  - The pseudotime extraction and check for “dpt_pseudotime” is robust and follows good practice.
  - When iterating over genes, ensure that the loop covers only the highly variable genes if that’s intended; consider explicitly filtering cd4_cells.var_names based on cd4_cells.var['highly_variable'].
  - There is no correction for multiple hypothesis testing when filtering p‐values (p < 0.01); consider adding a multiple testing correction (e.g., Benjamini–Hochberg) to reduce false positives.
  - Converting sparse matrices to dense arrays is handled correctly, but remember to verify memory constraints with larger datasets.
  - The heatmap plotting uses imshow, which works, but using seaborn’s clustermap or scanpy’s heatmap functions could provide more informative visualizations (e.g., including dendrograms or color annotations).

• Analysis Plan Feedback:
  - The plan is focused and coherent with the hypothesis by connecting pseudotime trajectories with gene expression.
  - Steps are logically ordered and build upon previous analyses without repetition.
  - Statistical testing is incorporated (via Spearman correlations) although consider reporting multiple testing–corrected p-values.
  - Including subsequent pathway enrichment analysis for the selected gene modules will widen biological interpretation; ensure to integrate both positively and negatively correlated genes in the enrichment.
  - The visualization of the heatmap with cells ordered by pseudotime is a strong component—ensure that the figure clearly communicates the gradient of gene expression.
  - Overall, the plan presents a novel take on CD4 T cell activation/exhaustion state dynamics in COVID-19 without overlapping prior analyses.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The pseudotime correlation analysis suggests dynamic gene expression changes in CD4 T cells during the course of COVID-19. The focus on CD4 T cells is relevant as they play a crucial role in immune response modulation. Here are some observations and recommendations:

1. **Interferon-Related Genes**: Genes like IFI6, IFIT1, and IFIT3 are associated with the interferon response. The upregulation of these may indicate an active interferon signaling pathway, potentially contributing to immune dysregulation. This aligns with the study's interest in interferon-driven gene expression.

2. **Cytotoxicity and Activation Markers**: Genes such as GZMB (granzyme B) and CD8A/B are indicative of cytotoxic activity and immune activation. Elevated expression might suggest increased immune activation or cytotoxic potential in CD4 T cells.

3. **Receptor and Ligand Interaction**: Investigate further whether these expression changes correlate with altered receptor and ligand interactions between monocytes and T cells, given that cell-cell communication is a key hypothesis in the study.

4. **Transcription Factors and Cell State**: Analyze transcription factors such as KLF6 and BIRC3 to explore potential regulatory mechanisms driving these expression changes, which might illuminate shifts in cell states or functions.

5. **Future Steps**:
   - Validate these pseudotime trends with independent datasets to ensure robustness.
   - Extend the analysis to other immune cell types, particularly monocytes, to compare pseudotime dynamics and their correlation with gene expression changes.
   - Consider integrating data on patient clinical outcomes to correlate gene expression trends with disease severity or progression.

The results of this pseudotime analysis appear promising for understanding the immune alterations in severe COVID-19, and further exploration can substantiate the hypothesized dysregulated immune communication pathways.

PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps.

Here are the previous analyses attempted:
In severe COVID‐19 patients, key immune cells (particularly CD14 Monocytes and dendritic cells) exhibit stronger coordination between antigen presentation (HLA1) and interferon response (IFN1) compared to healthy controls, suggesting dysregulated immune signaling that could contribute to disease severity.
In severe COVID-19, prolonged disease duration (reflected by higher DPS values) is associated with increased mitochondrial stress in adaptive immune cells (specifically CD4 T and CD8 T cells), suggesting that extended immune activation leads to metabolic dysregulation.
In severe COVID-19, immune cells—particularly T cells and monocytes—exhibit altered ribosomal content, which may reflect a dysregulated translation machinery that is coupled with an enhanced interferon response.
In severe COVID‐19, platelets exhibit sex-specific transcriptional differences in genes related to activation and coagulation, potentially contributing to the clinically observed differences in thrombotic risk between males and females.
Severe COVID-19 is associated with increased transcriptional heterogeneity in immune cells, reflecting dysregulated gene expression control. This analysis tests whether individual cells from COVID patients exhibit higher variance in gene expression compared to healthy controls.


Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
The paper focuses on severe COVID-19, a condition induced by SARS‑CoV‑2 infection that, in a subset of patients, progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.

Biological background  
Key biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.

Paper’s computational analyses  
A series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: NK cells in severe COVID‐19 patients exhibit an increased exhaustion gene signature compared to healthy controls, potentially reflecting impaired cytotoxic function in these cells.

Analysis Plan:
1. Subset the dataset to focus exclusively on NK cells using the 'cell_type_coarse' annotation.
2. Define a custom exhaustion gene signature including known markers such as PDCD1, LAG3, TIGIT, HAVCR2, and CTLA4.
3. Calculate an exhaustion score for each NK cell using the sc.tl.score_genes function with the defined gene list.
4. Examine the distribution of exhaustion scores between COVID and Healthy samples by generating violin plots for comparative visualization.
5. Perform a statistical test (Mann-Whitney U test) on the exhaustion scores of NK cells between the two groups to assess the significance of the observed differences.
6. Summarize the findings and create additional figures (if necessary) displaying the correlation between exhaustion scores and key metadata (e.g., DPS or Admission) to further understand the impact on disease severity.

Initial Code:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Subsetting adata for NK cells based on 'cell_type_coarse' annotation
nk_adata = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'NK'].copy()

# Quick exploratory visualization of NK cells by their source status
sc.pl.umap(nk_adata, color=['Status'], title='NK Cells: Status (COVID vs Healthy)', show=True)

NK cells in severe COVID‐19 patients exhibit an increased exhaustion gene signature compared to healthy controls, potentially reflecting impaired cytotoxic function in these cells.

Analysis Plan:
["Subset the dataset to focus exclusively on NK cells using the 'cell_type_coarse' annotation.", 'Define a custom exhaustion gene signature including known markers such as PDCD1, LAG3, TIGIT, HAVCR2, and CTLA4.', 'Calculate an exhaustion score for each NK cell using the sc.tl.score_genes function with the defined gene list.', 'Examine the distribution of exhaustion scores between COVID and Healthy samples by generating violin plots for comparative visualization.', 'Perform a statistical test (Mann-Whitney U test) on the exhaustion scores of NK cells between the two groups to assess the significance of the observed differences.', 'Summarize the findings and create additional figures (if necessary) displaying the correlation between exhaustion scores and key metadata (e.g., DPS or Admission) to further understand the impact on disease severity.']

# Subsetting adata for NK cells based on 'cell_type_coarse' annotation
nk_adata = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'NK'].copy()

# Quick exploratory visualization of NK cells by their source status
sc.pl.umap(nk_adata, color=['Status'], title='NK Cells: Status (COVID vs Healthy)', show=True)

Feedback:
• Code Feedback:
 – The code correctly subsets the anndata object for NK cells using the ‘cell_type_coarse’ annotation and creates a UMAP plot colored by “Status” (COVID vs Healthy), which is appropriate for an exploratory visualization.
 – Consider adding a safeguard to check that NK cells are present; for example, print the number of NK cells after subsetting to ensure the subset isn’t empty.
 – Ensure that the UMAP embedding has been computed for adata before subsetting or include a note that NK-specific neighbors/UMAP should be computed if necessary.

• Analysis Plan Feedback:
 – The analysis plan is well-focused on testing the hypothesis of increased exhaustion gene signature in NK cells of severe COVID‐19 patients. It defines clear, sequential steps.
 – The plan to use custom exhaustion gene signatures (e.g., PDCD1, LAG3, TIGIT, HAVCR2, CTLA4) and score them per cell using sc.tl.score_genes is appropriate. It might be useful to justify or mention any potential additional markers or reference sets for more robust scoring.
 – The intent to use violin plots for comparing distributions and a Mann-Whitney U test for statistical significance is solid; be sure to print out the test statistics and p-values as stipulated.
 – Future steps that correlate exhaustion scores with metadata (like DPS or Admission) provide an excellent extension to understand clinical associations.
 – Overall, the plan builds on prior analyses without redundancy and focuses on a novel NK cell exhaustion angle.

Both the code and plan adhere to the provided guidelines, but slight improvements (such as data checking in the code and additional marker justification in the plan) could further strengthen the approach.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: NK cells in severe COVID‐19 patients exhibit an increased exhaustion gene signature compared to healthy controls, potentially reflecting impaired cytotoxic function. This analysis will leverage established markers (PDCD1, LAG3, TIGIT, HAVCR2, CTLA4) and may be extended with additional markers to robustly capture the exhaustion phenotype.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Subset the dataset to focus exclusively on NK cells using the 'cell_type_coarse' annotation and verify that the subset is non-empty.
2. Define a custom exhaustion gene signature including known markers such as PDCD1, LAG3, TIGIT, HAVCR2, and CTLA4, with consideration for any additional relevant markers.
3. Calculate an exhaustion score for each NK cell using the sc.tl.score_genes function with the defined gene list.
4. Examine the distribution of exhaustion scores between COVID and Healthy samples by generating violin plots for comparative visualization.
5. Perform a statistical test (Mann-Whitney U test) on the exhaustion scores of NK cells between the two groups to assess the significance of the observed differences, printing the test statistics and p-values.
6. Summarize the findings and create additional figures (if necessary) displaying the correlation between exhaustion scores and key metadata (e.g., DPS or Admission) to further understand the impact on disease severity.

Revised Code:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Check if NK cells are present in the dataset
nk_cells = adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'NK'
if nk_cells.sum() == 0:
    raise ValueError("No NK cells found in the dataset. Please verify the 'cell_type_coarse' annotation.")

# Subset adata for NK cells based on 'cell_type_coarse' annotation
nk_adata = adata[nk_cells].copy()
print(f"Number of NK cells: {nk_adata.shape[0]}")

# Note: Ensure that UMAP embedding is computed for the full dataset. If not, consider computing neighbors and UMAP specifically for nk_adata.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The UMAP plot shows a clear separation between NK cells from COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals, suggesting distinct transcriptional profiles influenced by the disease. This supports the hypothesis that there is altered cell-cell communication involving immune cells in severe COVID-19.

**Feedback and Suggestions:**

1. **Further Clustering:**
   - Perform sub-clustering of NK cells to identify sub-populations that may have different functional roles or states in response to severe COVID-19.

2. **Differential Expression Analysis:**
   - Conduct differential expression analysis on identified NK cell clusters to discover key genes driving the separation. Focus on genes related to cytokine signaling, receptor expression, and exhaustion markers.

3. **Ligand-Receptor Interaction Analysis:**
   - Investigate ligand-receptor pairs specifically involving NK cells and monocytes or T cells to assess changes in cell-cell communication driving immunopathology.

4. **Functional Enrichment:**
   - Perform pathway enrichment analysis on DE genes to identify disrupted signaling cascades or immune pathways in severe COVID-19 patients.

5. **Integration with Clinical Data:**
   - Correlate transcriptional changes in NK cells with clinical metadata (e.g., ARDS status, duration of symptoms) to link molecular findings to clinical outcomes.

6. **Validation with Additional Datasets:**
   - Validate findings using additional datasets or techniques such as flow cytometry to confirm phenotypic changes observed in NK cells.

These analyses will help validate the hypothesis and provide insights into immune dysregulation mechanisms in severe COVID-19.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Distinct subpopulations exist within NK cells where a subset in severe COVID‐19 patients may exhibit an accentuated exhaustion signature relative to healthy controls.

Analysis Plan:
['Perform subclustering on the NK cell subset: Identify highly variable genes, scale data, and run PCA on nk_adata.', 'Construct a neighborhood graph and execute Leiden clustering to delineate NK cell subpopulations.', 'Compute a UMAP embedding of the NK cells colored both by cluster and disease status to visualize subpopulation structure.', 'Define a custom exhaustion gene signature (including PDCD1, LAG3, TIGIT, HAVCR2, CTLA4, and an additional marker TOX) and calculate an exhaustion score per cell.', 'Visualize the distribution of exhaustion scores across the identified NK subclusters and between COVID and healthy samples via violin plots.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Assuming nk_adata is already subsetted from the original anndata
# Step 1: Preprocess NK cells - identify highly variable genes and scale the data
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(nk_adata, flavor='seurat', n_top_genes=2000)
sc.pp.scale(nk_adata, max_value=10)

# Step 2: Dimensionality reduction via PCA
sc.tl.pca(nk_adata, n_comps=50, svd_solver='arpack')

# Step 3: Construct neighborhood graph and compute UMAP
sc.pp.neighbors(nk_adata, n_neighbors=10, n_pcs=30)
sc.tl.umap(nk_adata)

# Step 4: Perform Leiden clustering to identify NK subpopulations
sc.tl.leiden(nk_adata, resolution=0.5, key_added='nk_clusters')

# Visualize UMAP with clusters and status
sc.pl.umap(nk_adata, color=['nk_clusters', 'Status'], title=['NK Subtype Clusters', 'Status (COVID vs Healthy)'], show=True)

# Step 5: Define custom exhaustion gene signature
exhaustion_genes = ['PDCD1', 'LAG3', 'TIGIT', 'HAVCR2', 'CTLA4', 'TOX']

# Calculate exhaustion score based on the defined gene list
sc.tl.score_genes(nk_adata, gene_list=exhaustion_genes, score_name='exhaustion_score')

# Visualize exhaustion scores as a violin plot across NK clusters and by Status
sc.pl.violin(nk_adata, keys='exhaustion_score', groupby='nk_clusters', stripplot=True, jitter=0.4, title='Exhaustion Score Distribution by NK Subcluster', show=True)
sc.pl.violin(nk_adata, keys='exhaustion_score', groupby='Status', stripplot=True, jitter=0.4, title='Exhaustion Score Distribution by Status', show=True)

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python code for Step 1:
• The overall preprocessing workflow (feature selection, scaling, PCA, neighborhood graph, UMAP, clustering, and exhaustion scoring) is well structured and clearly implements the intended analysis plan.
• Usage of sc.pp.highly_variable_genes with the ‘seurat’ flavor and limiting to the top 2000 genes is appropriate for NK cell subclustering.
• The parameters chosen for PCA (n_comps=50) and neighbors (n_neighbors=10, n_pcs=30) seem reasonable, but consider verifying that these settings capture sufficient variance in the NK subset to confirm cluster separation.
• The custom exhaustion signature is correctly defined and applied with sc.tl.score_genes. This step directly tests your hypothesis.
• Visualizations using UMAP and violin plots are clear and informative; using “show=True” complies with guidelines for display.
• While the code produces the necessary plots, consider including brief inline comments noting potential follow-up statistical tests (e.g., comparing exhaustion scores between clusters or statuses) for later steps.

Feedback on the analysis plan:
• The plan is concise and directly addresses the hypothesis—identifying NK subpopulations with a potential exhaustion signature in severe COVID‐19.
• Each step logically builds on the previous one and remains distinct from both the previously published analyses and earlier attempts.
• The plan appropriately integrates custom gene signature scoring, leveraging defined exhaustion markers to evaluate cell state.
• Future steps could benefit from incorporating statistical tests (e.g., Mann–Whitney U tests or t-tests) to assess significance in exhaustion score differences between groups.
• The plan maintains focus on NK cells, making full use of the available metadata (e.g., ‘Status’), while also considering using grid layouts or additional comparative visualizations in subsequent steps.

Overall, the code and analysis plan adhere to the coding guidelines and analytical objectives, with minor suggestions to enhance statistical evaluation in subsequent steps.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current analysis reveals several promising directions for further investigation:

1. **NK Subtype Clustering**: The UMAP plot shows distinct clusters of NK cell subtypes. This indicates a successful delineation of NK cell heterogeneity, which could be explored further for specific functional roles or expression patterns that differ between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls.

2. **Status Comparison (COVID vs. Healthy)**: The scatter plot suggests that COVID-19 and healthy samples have some overlapping but also distinct distribution in UMAP space. This could indicate differential gene expression or functional states between the two groups, warranting deeper exploration through differential expression analysis.

3. **Exhaustion Score by Subcluster**: The violin plot displays variance in exhaustion scores across NK subclusters. Identifying clusters with higher exhaustion scores could reveal specific NK cell types more affected in severe COVID-19. Subsequent pathway and gene set enrichment analyses could offer insights into the underlying biological mechanisms driving this exhaustion.

4. **Exhaustion Score by Status**: COVID-19 patients show a notable distribution of exhaustion scores compared to healthy controls. This supports the hypothesis that NK cell exhaustion is a feature of severe COVID-19 and can contribute to immunopathology. Future steps could include correlating exhaustion scores with clinical data, such as disease severity or outcomes, to validate their clinical relevance.

5. **Iterative Analysis**: Based on these results, it would be beneficial to refine clustering approaches or explore additional clustering parameters, such as leveraging known marker genes for NK cell subtypes, to enhance the identification of subtle population differences.

6. **Functional Validation**: To substantiate these findings, targeted experiments or flow cytometry could validate the transcriptional exhaustion profiles of the NK cells identified through scRNA-seq.

Integrating these insights with other immune cell types, as the hypothesis suggests, could reveal the broader scope of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 and provide clearer targets for therapeutic intervention.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
NK cells in severe COVID‐19 patients with higher exhaustion scores will exhibit significantly different clinical profiles, such as increased disease duration (DPS) and altered admission status, compared to NK cells from healthy controls, indicating a potential link between NK cell exhaustion and disease severity.

Analysis Plan:
['Perform a Mann-Whitney U test to determine if the distribution of exhaustion scores significantly differs between COVID and healthy NK cells.', 'Investigate the relationship between exhaustion scores and clinical parameters (e.g., DPS) via Spearman correlation analysis.', 'Visualize these analyses using violin plots annotated with p-values and scatter plots showing the correlation between exhaustion scores and DPS.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Assuming nk_adata is already subsetted for NK cells and contains 'exhaustion_score', 'Status', and 'DPS'

# Perform Mann-Whitney U test comparing exhaustion scores in NK cells between COVID and Healthy samples
covid_scores = nk_adata.obs.loc[nk_adata.obs['Status'] == 'COVID', 'exhaustion_score']
healthy_scores = nk_adata.obs.loc[nk_adata.obs['Status'] == 'Healthy', 'exhaustion_score']

u_stat, p_value = stats.mannwhitneyu(covid_scores, healthy_scores, alternative='two-sided')

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan Feedback:
 – The plan is focused and builds on the unique hypothesis regarding NK cell exhaustion, clinical parameters, and disease severity. It uses appropriate statistical tests (Mann–Whitney U and Spearman correlation) and visualizations to assess differences and associations, which aligns with the hypothesis.
 – Consider expanding the plan to also assess differences in admission status (or other categorical clinical parameters) as suggested by the hypothesis. For example, a chi-squared test or logistic regression might be useful to complement the current analyses.
 – Ensure that the analysis remains self-contained by strictly using metadata from the anndata object and by building on the previous steps without redundancy.

• Python Code Feedback:
 – The code correctly subsets exhaustion scores for COVID and healthy NK cells, performs a Mann–Whitney U test, and annotates the resulting violin plot—which adheres to the expected structure.
 – In the Spearman correlation block, converting the ‘DPS’ column within a subset may trigger a SettingWithCopy warning. Using covid_data = nk_adata.obs[nk_adata.obs['Status'] == 'COVID'].copy() would avoid this potential pitfall.
 – To improve consistency with the guideline on displaying multiple figures, consider organizing both the violin and scatter plots in a grid layout rather than creating separate figure windows.
 – The code adheres to the approved packages and the overall plotting style is clear. Make sure each figure is displayed and not saved, which you have done using plt.show().
 – Finally, ensure that any additional tests or visualizations (e.g., for altered admission status) are integrated later to fully capture the clinical profile differences stated in the hypothesis.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

### Feedback on Analysis

1. **Exhaustion Score Distribution by Status:**
   - **Mann-Whitney U Test:**
     - The significant p-value (3.968e-05) indicates a significant difference in exhaustion scores between COVID and healthy individuals. 
     - This difference might suggest biological relevance and should be further explored to understand the potential mechanisms behind the exhaustion.

2. **Correlation between DPS and Exhaustion Score:**
   - **Spearman Correlation:**
     - The weak correlation (rho = -0.02206) with a non-significant p-value (0.3065) suggests no strong association between DPS and exhaustion score in NK cells.
     - Consider investigating other factors or variables that might better explain changes in exhaustion scores.

3. **Admission Status Distribution:**
   - **Chi-Squared Test:**
     - The result indicates a significant difference in admission status distribution (p-value = 0).
     - This could point toward differences in clinical outcomes based on exhaustion or other cell phenotypes, which warrants deeper analysis involving clinical metadata.

### Future Steps

- **Investigate Exhaustion Mechanisms:**
  - Focus on identifying key genes or pathways significantly altered in cells with high exhaustion scores. This could provide insights into potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

- **Examine Other Correlations:**
  - Explore other potential correlates of exhaustion scores not limited to DPS, such as specific cytokine expressions or receptor-ligand interactions. 
  - This could yield a better understanding of the biological pathways at play.

- **Integrate Clinical Outcomes:**
  - Consider integrating more clinical outcome data to see how they relate to cellular exhaustion scores. For instance, correlate these scores with severity metrics like ICU admission or survival rates.

- **Differentiate Among Cell Populations:**
  - Conduct further sub-clustering of specific immune cell types, particularly NK cells, to see if particular subsets are more affected in severe COVID-19, as preliminary analyses in the paper suggest.

- **Pathway and Gene Set Analyses:**
  - Perform pathway enrichment analyses to understand the systems-level impact of transcriptional changes, focusing on interferon signaling, HLA expression, and responses to inflammatory ligands.

This analysis direction could help in discovering novel insights into the immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 and the role of NK cell exhaustion in this process.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
NK cells with high exhaustion scores express distinct sets of genes—possibly linked to metabolic pathways and immune regulation—that drive their dysfunctional state in severe COVID-19. Identifying these genes through differential expression analysis could reveal novel pathways underlying NK cell exhaustion.

Analysis Plan:
['Assign NK cells into high and low exhaustion groups by splitting on the median exhaustion score.', 'Perform a differential expression analysis comparing high exhaustion (HighEx) versus low exhaustion (LowEx) NK cells using sc.tl.rank_genes_groups with the Wilcoxon test.', 'Visualize the top differentially expressed genes using a dot plot to highlight potential pathways or mechanisms associated with exhaustion.', 'Interpret the findings to integrate potential biological roles of the differentially expressed genes in NK cell dysfunction and severe COVID-19.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define threshold: split NK cells into 'HighEx' and 'LowEx' groups based on the median exhaustion score
median_score = nk_adata.obs['exhaustion_score'].median()
nk_adata.obs['Exhaustion_Group'] = nk_adata.obs['exhaustion_score'].apply(lambda x: 'HighEx' if x >= median_score else 'LowEx')

# Perform differential expression analysis using the Wilcoxon test
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(nk_adata, groupby='Exhaustion_Group', groups=['HighEx'], reference='LowEx', method='wilcoxon')

# Visualize the top 10 differentially expressed genes using a dot plot
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot(nk_adata, n_genes=10, groupby='Exhaustion_Group', show=True)


Feedback:
Feedback on the Python Code for the First Step:
• The code cleanly splits NK cells into “HighEx” and “LowEx” groups using the median exhaustion score and applies the Wilcoxon test. This is appropriate and readable.
• Consider adding a brief output or print statement that displays the top-ranking genes (e.g., by extracting and printing nk_adata.uns['rank_genes_groups']) so that numerical results are directly communicated alongside the dot plot.
• Verify that the exhaustion score was computed in a previous cell so this splitting step uses appropriate and comparable values.
• The dot plot is generated with a fixed n_genes=10; if the dataset permits, you might consider parameterizing this (or showing additional plots) to ensure robust visualization across possible subpopulations.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The hypothesis is clearly focused on linking NK cell exhaustion to distinct gene expression patterns, which is distinct from the analyses in the paper and past attempts.
• The plan’s step‐by‐step outline is concise and biologically motivated, with appropriate use of statistical tests and visualization methods.
• Ensure that subsequent steps build on these results by integrating pathway enrichment or extra validation measures, which can further leverage metadata available in the anndata object.
• The plan adheres well to the guidelines, but make sure each analysis remains self-contained. Revisit the group definition if sample sizes are low—considering alternative thresholds or robustness checks if needed.

Overall, both the modular code and the planned steps are well aligned with the hypothesis and guidelines, with the suggestions above helping to further enhance output interpretability and rigor.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The analysis reveals a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for HighEx compared to LowEx, featuring genes such as TIGIT, HAVCR2, TOX, and LAG3, which are often associated with immune regulation and exhaustion. These findings align with concerns about immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19, suggesting potential pathways involved in immune exhaustion. Notably, genes like GZMB and CCL5, which are tied to cytotoxic responses and chemotaxis, further emphasize altered immune mechanisms.

### Feedback:

1. **Relevance to Hypothesis:**
   - The upregulation of immune exhaustion markers (e.g., TIGIT, LAG3) might corroborate with the hypothesis concerning altered cell-cell communication. It could suggest increased immune suppression or dysfunction in severe COVID-19.
   
2. **Next Steps in Analysis:**
   - **Cell Type Specific Analysis:** Explore which cell types predominantly express these DEGs in HighEx to pinpoint specific immune cell behaviors.
   - **Pathway Analysis:** Conduct pathway and gene set enrichment analyses on DEGs to understand broader functional implications.
   - **Cell-Cell Interaction Modeling:** Utilize ligand-receptor pair databases to model enhanced communication pathways, focusing on monocyte and T cell interactions to see if they are enriched for these specific DEGs.
   
3. **Distinctiveness:**
   - This DEG set appears distinct from those previously analyzed. None of the past analyses explicitly focused on these specific exhaustion or cytotoxic genes, providing a novel angle for understanding immune dysregulation.

4. **Further Validation:**
   - **Broader Sample Set:** Validate these findings across a broader dataset or different cohorts to assess consistency.
   - **Correlation with Clinical Outcomes:** Investigate if expression profiles of these genes correlate with clinical severity or outcomes, providing clinical relevance.

These steps will help refine the understanding of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19, potentially uncovering therapeutic targets or biomarkers for disease progression.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
While NK cells exhibit a pronounced exhaustion signature, the top DEGs in NK HighEx cells may also be expressed in other immune cell types, hinting at broader immune dysregulation mechanisms in severe COVID‐19.

Analysis Plan:
['Extract the top differentially expressed genes from the HighEx NK cell group.', "Assess the expression pattern of these genes across all immune cell types using the 'cell_type_coarse' annotation.", 'Visualize the average expression and percentage of expressing cells via a dot plot to pinpoint cell types enriched for these exhaustion markers.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Attempt to extract the top DEGs for HighEx cells from the previous differential expression analysis
if 'rank_genes_groups' in nk_adata.uns:
    # Get the top 10 genes for HighEx group
    top_genes = list(nk_adata.uns['rank_genes_groups']['names']['HighEx'][:10])
else:
    # Fallback to the predefined exhaustion gene list if differential expression is not available
    top_genes = ['PDCD1', 'LAG3', 'TIGIT', 'HAVCR2', 'CTLA4', 'TOX']

print('Top genes for HighEx NK cells:', top_genes)

# Use the global adata (all cells) to assess the expression of these genes across different immune cell types
# The grouping is done by the 'cell_type_coarse' annotation
sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names=top_genes, groupby='cell_type_coarse',
              standard_scale='var', dot_max=0.7,
              title='Expression of NK HighEx DEGs across Immune Cell Types', show=True)

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python Code for Step 1:
• The code correctly checks whether differential expression results exist and falls back to a predefined list, which is robust.
• Using sc.pl.dotplot with the “cell_type_coarse” annotation efficiently meets the goal of assessing gene patterns across immune cell types.
• Consider ensuring that the variable nk_adata is explicitly defined and preprocessed before running this step so that its metadata (including exhaustion scores and DE results) are available.
• It would be useful to add inline comments clarifying that this dot plot visualizes both the average expression and percent detected, which fits the analysis plan.

Feedback on the Overall Analysis Plan:
• The plan clearly targets the hypothesis of broader immune dysregulation by examining expression of top NK exhaustion DEGs in other immune populations.
• The plan is novel in contrasting NK cell exhaustion signatures with expression in other cell types, providing a fresh view beyond the previous analyses and the paper.
• To further strengthen the plan, consider incorporating statistical tests comparing expression levels of these genes across important immune cell types (e.g., using non-parametric tests) and include those p-values in your plots.
• Ensure that subsequent steps build on this analysis without repeating previous clustering and DE analyses; linking the current gene-level visualization to downstream cell–cell interaction analyses would enhance impact.
• Overall, both the code snippet and analysis plan meet the guidelines and focus on the core hypothesis while maintaining novelty relative to the original paper and previous attempts.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results indicate the expression of top genes in high-expressing NK cells found in the context of severe COVID-19. Key genes like TIGIT, HAVCR2, and TOX suggest potential exhaustion or dysregulation in NK cells, which is consistent with the immune alterations observed in severe cases.

### Feedback:

1. **Investigate Functional Roles:**
   - Explore the functional roles of these genes, particularly in NK cell exhaustion or dysfunction. TIGIT and LAG3 are known immune checkpoints, which might suggest a state of reduced NK cell effectiveness.

2. **Compare with Previous Findings:**
   - While previous analyses focused on monocytes and interferon responses, this finding offers a novel perspective on NK cells. Consider comparing these results to existing literature to see if similar patterns are observed in NK cells in severe COVID-19.

3. **Pathway Analysis:**
   - Conduct pathway enrichment analysis for these genes to identify biological pathways that are significantly impacted in NK cells. This could give insight into the broader functional consequences of observed expression changes.

4. **Correlation with Clinical Outcomes:**
   - Analyze whether the expression of these genes correlates with clinical outcomes like disease severity or progression. This might help establish their role as potential biomarkers.

5. **Explore Interactions:**
   - Given the hypothesis on cell-cell communication, examine how these findings in NK cells might interact with alterations in monocyte or T cell functions. This could reveal insights into dysregulated immune interactions in COVID-19.

6. **Extend to Other Cell Types:**
   - Assess whether these genes are dysregulated in other immune cell types in the context of COVID-19. This could highlight shared or unique pathways affected across different cell types.

These steps can expand the understanding of NK cell alterations and their potential contribution to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
High exhaustion in NK cells is hypothesized to be associated with coordinated dysregulation of gene modules, including those involved in immune inhibitory signaling and metabolic pathways, which may underlie impaired cytotoxic function in severe COVID‐19.

Analysis Plan:
['Compute the Spearman correlation between the exhaustion scores and expression levels of each gene in the NK cell subset.', 'Identify the top 10 genes that are most positively correlated and the top 10 genes that are most negatively correlated with the exhaustion score.', 'Visualize these correlations using a barplot to display the strength and direction of the gene–exhaustion relationships.', 'Generate a clustermap of the standardized expression profiles of the selected top correlated genes across NK cells (with cells ordered by exhaustion score) to observe potential co-expression modules.', 'Interpret the structure of these gene modules in the context of NK cell function and clinical metadata.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy import stats

# Convert NK cell expression data to a DataFrame
# If nk_adata.X is sparse, convert it to a dense array
expr_df = pd.DataFrame(nk_adata.X.A if hasattr(nk_adata.X, 'A') else nk_adata.X,
                       index=nk_adata.obs_names,
                       columns=nk_adata.var_names)

# Retrieve exhaustion scores for NK cells
exhaustion_scores = nk_adata.obs['exhaustion_score']

# Compute Spearman correlation between each gene's expression and the exhaustion score
gene_corr = {}
for gene in expr_df.columns:
    # Ensure the gene has variance
    if expr_df[gene].var() > 0:
        rho, pval = stats.spearmanr(expr_df[gene], exhaustion_scores)

Feedback:
• The analysis plan and code clearly focus on a novel evaluation of NK cell exhaustion by linking exhaustion scores to gene expression correlations. This distinct approach complements earlier analyses by exploring coordinated gene dysregulation.

• In the code, converting the expression matrix to a dense DataFrame is handled appropriately. However, if the dataset is large, you might consider using vectorized operations or slicing methods to improve efficiency without iterating over every gene.

• The loop that computes the Spearman correlation for each gene is straightforward and well‐commented. Consider also storing the p‐values to later filter significant correlations or to display them in plots.

• The selection of top 10 positively and negatively correlated genes is logical. Ensure that concatenating these lists does not mix genes with similar absolute rho values from opposite sides; verifying that the sorting criteria meet your interpretative goals could be beneficial.

• The barplot visualization is clear. For improved readability, you might sort the genes by their correlation coefficients before plotting and possibly annotate the bars with p‐values if available.

• The clustermap is generated on the standardized (z‐score) expression values of the selected genes. Note that ordering cells by exhaustion score is achieved by reordering the DataFrame—but clustermap by default performs clustering on both rows and columns. If you wish to preserve the cell ordering based on exhaustion score, consider turning off row clustering (e.g., set row_cluster=False) or providing a custom linkage.

• Overall, the code adheres to the given package and data usage guidelines and fits well within the outlined analysis plan, ensuring self-contained execution. The documentation and comments make the workflow easy to follow and maintain.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results from the analysis provide several insights that can be leveraged for further exploration:

1. **NK Subtype Clustering**: The UMAP plot demonstrates four distinct NK cell subtypes present in the data, which suggests potential heterogeneity in NK cell responses during severe COVID-19. This differentiation could be indicative of varied functional states or activation levels. Further differential expression analysis within these clusters could identify specific gene signatures associated with each subtype.

2. **Exhaustion Scores**: The violin plots indicate differences in exhaustion scores between NK clusters and between COVID-19 and healthy samples. Notably, cluster 3 appears to have a broader distribution with higher exhaustion scores, while NK cells from COVID-19 patients show higher exhaustion scores compared to healthy controls. This suggests a functional impairment in NK cells during severe COVID-19, which aligns with the hypothesis of immune exhaustion.

3. **Follow-up Analyses**:
   - Perform differential expression analysis within the NK clusters to identify genes driving the observed exhaustion profiles.
   - Conduct pathway enrichment analyses to discover pathways enriched in exhausted NK cells, particularly focusing on immune inhibitory pathways.
   - Explore the receptor-ligand interactions further, specifically focusing on NK-T cell communication pathways, which can provide insights into the dysregulated immune signaling.
   - Validate findings using additional datasets or through wet-lab experiments to confirm the role of exhausted NK cells in severe COVID-19.

4. **Biological Implications**: If exhaustion in NK cells is verified, strategies aiming at reversing this exhaustion, such as checkpoint inhibition or other immunomodulatory therapies, could be considered as potential therapeutic strategies for severe COVID-19.

Overall, these promising results warrant deeper investigation into NK cell heterogeneity and functional states, especially concerning exhaustion, to better understand their roles in severe COVID-19 pathology.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Genes whose expression levels correlate with the continuous exhaustion score in NK cells may reveal novel markers and pathways driving NK cell exhaustion in severe COVID‐19 patients.

Analysis Plan:
['Extract the continuous exhaustion scores from the NK cell subset (nk_adata) along with gene expression data.', 'For each gene, compute the Spearman correlation between its expression across NK cells and the exhaustion score.', 'Rank all genes based on the absolute value of their correlation coefficients and select the top candidates showing strongest positive or negative correlations.', 'Visualize the top correlated genes using a bar plot to display the correlation coefficients and annotate those findings with NK subcluster information.', 'Summarize the top correlated candidate markers whose expression trends may further explain NK cell exhaustion.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Extract exhaustion scores for NK cells
exhaustion_scores = nk_adata.obs['exhaustion_score'].values

# Initialize list to store correlation info
corr_results = []

# Loop over each gene in the NK cell dataset
for gene in nk_adata.var_names:
    # Extract expression values for the gene; handle sparse matrix if necessary
    expr = nk_adata[:, gene].X
    if hasattr(expr, 'toarray'):
        expr = expr.toarray().flatten()
    else:
        expr = np.array(expr).flatten()
    # Compute Spearman correlation between gene expression and exhaustion scores
    rho, p_val = stats.spearmanr(expr, exhaustion_scores)
    corr_results.append({'gene': gene, 'rho': rho, 'abs_rho': abs(rho), 'p_value': p_val})

# Convert results to DataFrame and sort by absolute correlation
corr_df = pd.DataFrame(corr_results)
corr_df = corr_df.sort_values(by='abs_rho', ascending=False)

# Select top 10 genes with the highest absolute correlation coefficients
top_genes_corr = corr_df.head(10)
print('Top 10 genes by Spearman correlation with exhaustion score:')
print(top_genes_corr[['gene', 'rho', 'p_value']])

# Visualization: Bar plot for correlation coefficients of top genes
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
bar = plt.bar(top_genes_corr['gene'], top_genes_corr['rho'], color='skyblue')
plt.xlabel('Gene')
plt.ylabel('Spearman Correlation Coefficient (rho)')
plt.title('Top 10 Genes Correlated with NK Cell Exhaustion Score')
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')

# Annotate bar plot with p-values
for rect, p_val in zip(bar, top_genes_corr['p_value']):
    height = rect.get_height()
    plt.text(rect.get_x() + rect.get_width()/2.0, height, f'p={p_val:.2g}', ha='center', va='bottom')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Feedback:
Feedback on the Code:
• The code is well structured and clearly commented, making it easy to follow how the Spearman correlations are computed gene‐by‐gene.
• It correctly handles both sparse and dense gene expression matrices, ensuring compatibility with different data types in nk_adata.
• The visualization is appropriately designed with a bar plot that annotates each bar with the corresponding p-value, which helps in quickly identifying statistically significant associations.
• An improvement could be to consider applying a multiple testing correction (e.g., Benjamini–Hochberg) on the p-values, given that a large number of correlations are being tested.
• Note that looping over genes is clear, but if computational efficiency becomes an issue later, exploring vectorized or parallelized approaches might be beneficial.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The hypothesis and planned analyses are novel relative to the paper and previous attempts, focusing specifically on exploring the correlation between NK cell exhaustion scores and gene expression.
• The plan’s step‐by‐step structure—from data extraction through correlation and visualization—is coherent and aligns well with the hypothesis.
• The inclusion of Spearman correlation (a non‐parametric test) is appropriate for the continuous nature of the exhaustion score.
• Visualizing the top correlated genes with annotations is an effective way to connect gene expression patterns with NK subclusters.
• Ensure that subsequent analysis steps build on these results without repeating preprocessing steps already handled in previous cells. This focus on a single core hypothesis remains tightly integrated with the overall study of NK cell dysfunction in severe COVID‐19.

Overall, both the code and the analysis plan are solid, adhere to the provided guidelines, and add a novel perspective to the existing analyses.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The analysis of gene correlations with an exhaustion score yielded promising results, highlighting several key immune-related genes. The top findings include TIGIT, HAVCR2, TOX, and LAG3, all positively correlated with exhaustion scores. These genes are known markers of T cell exhaustion, suggesting a potential link to immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19.

### Feedback and Recommendations:

1. **TIGIT, HAVCR2, TOX, LAG3**:
   - These genes are typically associated with T cell exhaustion, often observed in chronic infections and cancer. Given their strong correlation with exhaustion scores, further investigation into their expression across different T cell subsets (e.g., CD4+, CD8+) may reveal insights into the extent of exhaustion in these populations during severe COVID-19.

2. **CTLA4**:
   - Although less strongly correlated, CTLA4 still shows significant association. Its inclusion alongside other immune checkpoint molecules supports the possibility of a broader immune dysfunction, meriting additional analysis of its co-expression with the other exhaustion markers.

3. **CCL5, GZMB, GZMH**:
   - These genes are related to cytotoxic activity and immune regulation. Investigating their expression dynamics in NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes might provide clues about immune cell functionality and the role of cytotoxic pathways in severe cases.

4. **FOS, EEF1B2**:
   - These genes exhibit weaker, possibly inverse correlations and may represent different regulatory layers or cell states that merit exploration, perhaps as counterbalances or alternative pathways affecting exhaustion and immune response.

### Further Analysis:

- **Subpopulation Analysis**:
  Conduct deeper subclustering within T and NK cells to identify any novel exhausted subpopulations based on the expression of these correlated genes.

- **Pathway and Network Analysis**:
  Use pathway enrichment analysis to explore signaling pathways and networks these genes are involved in, correlating these pathways with clinical parameters like ARDS status or ventilation requirement.

- **Temporal Dynamics**:
  Examine longitudinal samples, if available, to understand if exhaustion markers change over the disease course, providing a time-resolved profile of immune dysfunction in severe COVID-19.

- **Comparative Analysis**:
  Conduct differential expression analysis comparing severe COVID-19 patients with healthy controls to affirm if these correlations are specifically heightened in severe disease contexts.

By integrating these findings with cell communication analysis, as outlined in your hypothesis, the role of these exhaustion-related genes in modulating monocyte and T cell interactions might reveal potential therapeutic targets to modulate immune response in severe COVID-19.

PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps.

Here are the previous analyses attempted:
In severe COVID‐19 patients, key immune cells (particularly CD14 Monocytes and dendritic cells) exhibit stronger coordination between antigen presentation (HLA1) and interferon response (IFN1) compared to healthy controls, suggesting dysregulated immune signaling that could contribute to disease severity.
In severe COVID-19, prolonged disease duration (reflected by higher DPS values) is associated with increased mitochondrial stress in adaptive immune cells (specifically CD4 T and CD8 T cells), suggesting that extended immune activation leads to metabolic dysregulation.
In severe COVID-19, immune cells—particularly T cells and monocytes—exhibit altered ribosomal content, which may reflect a dysregulated translation machinery that is coupled with an enhanced interferon response.
In severe COVID‐19, platelets exhibit sex-specific transcriptional differences in genes related to activation and coagulation, potentially contributing to the clinically observed differences in thrombotic risk between males and females.
Severe COVID-19 is associated with increased transcriptional heterogeneity in immune cells, reflecting dysregulated gene expression control. This analysis tests whether individual cells from COVID patients exhibit higher variance in gene expression compared to healthy controls.
NK cells in severe COVID‐19 patients exhibit an increased exhaustion gene signature compared to healthy controls, potentially reflecting impaired cytotoxic function. This analysis will leverage established markers (PDCD1, LAG3, TIGIT, HAVCR2, CTLA4) and may be extended with additional markers to robustly capture the exhaustion phenotype.


Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
The paper focuses on severe COVID-19, a condition induced by SARS‑CoV‑2 infection that, in a subset of patients, progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.

Biological background  
Key biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.

Paper’s computational analyses  
A series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: Severe COVID‐19 leads to dysregulation of programmed cell death pathways in peripheral immune cells, resulting in increased variability and a decoupling of apoptotic and pyroptotic gene expression programs compared to healthy individuals.

Analysis Plan:
1. Compute gene signature scores for apoptosis and pyroptosis using pre-defined gene sets, leveraging the sc.tl.score_genes function on the entire dataset.
2. Stratify cells by disease status (COVID vs Healthy) and focus on immune cell types of particular interest (such as CD14 Monocytes, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells) to assess cell type–specific differences.
3. Perform statistical comparisons (using a Mann–Whitney U test) of the computed apoptosis and pyroptosis scores between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls for each selected cell type.
4. Visualize the distributions of the apoptotic and pyroptotic scores using violin plots and scatter plots arranged in a grid, highlighting both overall differences and correlations between the two scores.
5. Evaluate the correlation between apoptosis and pyroptosis signatures within each cell type by computing correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values, thereby quantifying the decoupling of these cell death programs in severe COVID‐19.

Initial Code:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define gene sets for apoptosis and pyroptosis signatures
apoptosis_genes = ['CASP3', 'CASP8', 'BCL2', 'FADD', 'TRADD']
pyroptosis_genes = ['GSDMD', 'CASP1', 'NLRP3', 'IL18']

# Compute gene signature scores for all cells in the dataset
sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list=apoptosis_genes, score_name='score_apoptosis', use_raw=False)
sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list=pyroptosis_genes, score_name='score_pyroptosis', use_raw=False)

# Plot initial violin plots to inspect the computed scores across disease status
sc.pl.violin(adata, keys=['score_apoptosis', 'score_pyroptosis'], groupby='Status', jitter=0.4, multi_panel=True, show=True)

plt.show()

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Severe COVID‐19 leads to dysregulation of programmed cell death pathways in peripheral immune cells, resulting in increased variability and a decoupling of apoptotic and pyroptotic gene expression programs compared to healthy individuals.

Analysis Plan:
['Compute gene signature scores for apoptosis and pyroptosis using pre-defined gene sets, leveraging the sc.tl.score_genes function on the entire dataset.', 'Stratify cells by disease status (COVID vs Healthy) and focus on immune cell types of particular interest (such as CD14 Monocytes, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells) to assess cell type–specific differences.', 'Perform statistical comparisons (using a Mann–Whitney U test) of the computed apoptosis and pyroptosis scores between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls for each selected cell type.', 'Visualize the distributions of the apoptotic and pyroptotic scores using violin plots and scatter plots arranged in a grid, highlighting both overall differences and correlations between the two scores.', 'Evaluate the correlation between apoptosis and pyroptosis signatures within each cell type by computing correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values, thereby quantifying the decoupling of these cell death programs in severe COVID‐19.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define gene sets for apoptosis and pyroptosis signatures
apoptosis_genes = ['CASP3', 'CASP8', 'BCL2', 'FADD', 'TRADD']
pyroptosis_genes = ['GSDMD', 'CASP1', 'NLRP3', 'IL18']

# Compute gene signature scores for all cells in the dataset
sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list=apoptosis_genes, score_name='score_apoptosis', use_raw=False)
sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list=pyroptosis_genes, score_name='score_pyroptosis', use_raw=False)

# Plot initial violin plots to inspect the computed scores across disease status
sc.pl.violin(adata, keys=['score_apoptosis', 'score_pyroptosis'], groupby='Status', jitter=0.4, multi_panel=True, show=True)

plt.show()

Feedback:
Feedback on Python Code:
1. The code adheres to the guidelines by using only permitted packages and leveraging sc.tl.score_genes as intended. However, it would be beneficial to add a check that the specified gene symbols (e.g., “CASP3”) actually exist in adata.var_names to avoid potential runtime errors.
2. Although calling plt.show() after sc.pl.violin is not harmful, be aware that sc.pl.violin with show=True already displays the plot—consider omitting plt.show() or setting show=False for the scanpy plot and then arranging a grid of figures if you plan to add more plots later.
3. The scoring function option use_raw=False is acceptable if preprocessing was already carried out. Just confirm that the data in adata is appropriately normalized for gene signature scoring.
4. Adding inline comments explaining purpose (e.g., “compute apoptosis and pyroptosis scores across all cells”) can improve clarity and ease code reuse in subsequent steps.

Feedback on Analysis Plan:
1. The plan is well-structured and clearly lays out the steps from gene signature scoring to statistical tests and visualization. It correctly focuses on immune cell types of interest (CD14 Monocytes, CD4 T, and CD8 T cells) and fits within the novel hypothesis on cell death program decoupling.
2. The inclusion of both global score distribution (via violin plots) and further cell type–specific analyses is a strong design choice. Ensure that subsequent analysis steps build on this initial computation without repeating previous work.
3. Incorporating the Mann–Whitney U test and correlation coefficient calculations in later steps is appropriate but remember to print and display these statistical outputs clearly.
4. To further distinguish this analysis from prior attempts, consider expanding the gene sets if literature supports additional markers, or include a validation step comparing computed scores with known apoptotic/pyroptotic marker patterns.
5. Overall, the plan is cohesive, focused on the core hypothesis, and meets the requirement of being self-contained by exclusively utilizing metadata and transcriptomic data from adata.

By implementing these suggestions, the analysis will be more robust and clearly delineated from both the research paper’s and previous analyses.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: Severe COVID‐19 leads to dysregulation of programmed cell death pathways in peripheral immune cells, resulting in increased variability and a decoupling of apoptotic and pyroptotic gene expression programs compared to healthy individuals.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Check and compute gene signature scores for apoptosis and pyroptosis using pre-defined gene sets with a gene existence validation step to avoid runtime errors, leveraging sc.tl.score_genes on the entire dataset.
2. Stratify cells by disease status (COVID vs Healthy) and focus on immune cell types (CD14 Monocyte, CD4 T, and CD8 T) to assess cell type–specific differences without re-running already computed scores.
3. Perform statistical comparisons using the Mann–Whitney U test to compare apoptosis and pyroptosis scores between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls for each selected cell type, ensuring the test outputs are printed.
4. Visualize the distributions of apoptotic and pyroptotic scores using violin plots and scatter plots arranged on a grid to display both overall differences and score correlations.
5. Evaluate the correlation between apoptosis and pyroptosis signatures within each cell type by computing correlation coefficients and p-values to quantify the decoupling of these cell death programs in severe COVID‐19.

Revised Code:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define gene sets for apoptosis and pyroptosis signatures
apoptosis_genes = ['CASP3', 'CASP8', 'BCL2', 'FADD', 'TRADD']
pyroptosis_genes = ['GSDMD', 'CASP1', 'NLRP3', 'IL18']

# Verify that the specified gene symbols exist in the dataset to avoid runtime errors
existing_apoptosis_genes = [gene for gene in apoptosis_genes if gene in adata.var_names]
missing_apoptosis_genes = set(apoptosis_genes) - set(existing_apoptosis_genes)

existing_pyroptosis_genes = [gene for gene in pyroptosis_genes if gene in adata.var_names]
missing_pyroptosis_genes = set(pyroptosis_genes) - set(existing_pyroptosis_genes)
if missing_pyroptosis_genes:
    print('Warning: The following pyroptosis genes are not present in adata.var_names:', missing_pyroptosis_genes)

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The analysis results indicate scores for apoptosis and pyroptosis for COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Here is my feedback to guide future steps and validate the hypothesis:

1. **Interpretation of Scores**:
   - The similar distribution of apoptosis and pyroptosis scores between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls suggests no strong differential regulation at a broad level. This could mean that these processes are not substantially altered in COVID-19 or are not distinctly captured with the current gene sets.

2. **Refinement of Gene Sets**:
   - Review and potentially refine the gene sets used for scoring apoptosis and pyroptotic pathways to ensure they are comprehensive and specific to features of COVID-19 pathophysiology.

3. **Cell Type-Specific Analysis**:
   - Perform cell type-specific analyses to detect more subtle, yet biologically significant, differences in apoptosis and pyroptosis. Specific subsets such as monocytes or T cells may exhibit more pronounced changes.

4. **Hypothesis Validation**:
   - The hypothesis regarding enhanced monocyte-T cell ligand-receptor interactions due to inflammatory signaling remains untested at this step. Consider examining expression levels of relevant cytokines and receptors in conjunction with apoptosis/pyroptosis scores.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - Integrate ligand-receptor interaction analyses to directly assess the hypothesis about dysregulated communication in severe COVID-19.
   - Use alternative approaches like pathway enrichment analysis to contextualize apoptosis and pyroptosis findings within the broader immune response landscape in severe COVID-19.

6. **Explore Additional Cell Death Pathways**:
   - Given the lack of clear differentiation observed, exploring additional cell death pathways like necroptosis or ferroptosis might be beneficial, offering new insights into differential immune responses.

7. **Validation and Contextual Relationship**:
   - Validate findings with additional datasets or experimental approaches, and examine how cell death pathways relate to previously identified immune alterations in the dataset.

This approach will help refine the analyses and better address the underlying hypotheses, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
In severe COVID‐19, cell–cell communication between CD14 Monocytes and T cells is altered, leading to subtle cell death pathway dysregulation that is not detected at the bulk level. Specifically, monocytes might upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) while T cells increase the expression of corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R), potentially linking differential apoptosis and pyroptosis scores to enhanced ligand–receptor interactions.

Analysis Plan:
["Subset the data to focus on the key immune cell types (CD14 Monocyte, CD4 T, and CD8 T) using the 'cell_type_coarse' annotation.", 'Within each subset, compare the previously computed apoptosis and pyroptosis scores between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls using violin plots and Mann–Whitney U tests.', 'For CD14 Monocytes, assess the expression levels of inflammatory ligands (TNF, IL1B, IL6); for T cells (CD4 T and CD8 T), assess the expression of corresponding receptors (TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R) using cell-type specific violin plots.', 'Print the statistical test outputs to determine if significant differences exist in both cell death pathway scores and ligand/receptor gene expression between the groups, which may support enhanced monocyte-T cell crosstalk in severe COVID-19.']

Feedback:
Feedback on the Code:
1. The code correctly subsets the anndata object by cell type and generates violin plots for apoptosis and pyroptosis scores as well as for ligand/receptor gene expression. However, consider wrapping repetitive plotting steps into helper functions to reduce redundancy.
2. When using sc.pl.violin with pre-created matplotlib axes, verify that the integration works as expected with Scanpy’s plotting functions; some versions may require explicit handling of axes objects.
3. The Mann–Whitney U tests are applied appropriately, but it might be beneficial to specify the “alternative” parameter (e.g., alternative='two-sided') to ensure clarity in hypothesis testing, especially when p-values are reported.
4. Add a check to confirm that both COVID and Healthy groups have enough cells before running the statistical tests to avoid errors on small subgroups.
5. Including inline comments to clarify each step could improve code readability for future users.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
1. The analysis plan is well-focused on the central hypothesis and deliberately avoids overlap with the paper’s and previous analyses, which is commendable.
2. While comparing apoptosis/pyroptosis scores and ligand/receptor expression between groups is a solid starting point, consider incorporating quantitative measures of cell–cell communication (e.g., correlation analyses between ligand expression in monocytes and receptor expression in T cells) to further link the observed differences.
3. Integration with downstream visualization (e.g., combined grid plots for multiple cell types) could enhance the impact of the findings.
4. The plan meets the coding guidelines and uses only the allowed packages; however, ensure that future steps continue to build on existing analyses without reloading or reprocessing data already computed.
5. Overall, the hypothesis is novel and the plan is coherent. A slight expansion to include cell–cell interaction metrics could make the analysis even more compelling.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results indicate significant differences in apoptosis and pyroptosis between COVID-19 and healthy individuals across all cell types analyzed (CD14 monocytes, CD4 T, and CD8 T cells), as evidenced by the low p-values. This suggests that these processes might play a role in the immune response during severe COVID-19.

**Feedback and Future Steps:**

1. **Evaluate Hypothesis:**
   - The significant p-values support the hypothesis that apoptosis and pyroptosis are potentially involved in COVID-19 pathology. Further analysis could explore how these processes may interact or influence immune signaling pathways.

2. **Explore Ligand-Receptor Interactions:**
   - Despite initial hypotheses, the ligand (TNF, IL1B, IL6) and receptor (TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R) expressions in monocytes and T cells appear similar in COVID-19 and healthy controls. This suggests that rather than upregulation, altered signaling may occur due to changes in cell sensitivity or receptor affinity. Future work could involve signaling pathway analysis or downstream target evaluation.

3. **Investigate Functional Outcomes:**
   - Given the alteration in apoptosis/pyroptosis pathways, assess functional consequences such as cytokine release, cell-cell communication alterations, or downstream immune responses to better understand their role in disease progression.

4. **Integrate with Existing Data:**
   - Compare these findings with the existing analyses for a comprehensive understanding. Particularly, examine mitochondrial stress and ribosomal content changes in these contexts to identify potential links or combined effects.

5. **Further Characterization:**
   - Subcluster analysis within these immune cell populations could reveal specific subsets more strongly associated with these apoptotic/pyroptotic processes, offering insights into potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

6. **Broaden Analytical Scope:**
   - Consider addressing immune heterogeneity by performing trajectory analysis to explore how these apoptosis/pyroptosis signatures may change with disease progression or treatment.

This direction not only supports the current findings but also offers a novel perspective distinct from previous analyses. The next steps should aim to clarify the mechanistic pathways and their implications in severe COVID-19 pathology.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
In severe COVID‐19, dysregulated apoptosis and pyroptosis in immune cells are associated with altered interferon response and antigen presentation, potentially impacting downstream immune signaling and responses.

Analysis Plan:
["Subset the cells for each key immune cell type (CD14 Monocyte, CD4 T, and CD8 T) using the 'cell_type_coarse' metadata.", 'For each cell type, generate scatter plots correlating apoptosis scores with interferon response (IFN1) and pyroptosis scores with antigen presentation (HLA1).', 'Compute Spearman correlation coefficients and p-values for these relationships separately in COVID and Healthy groups to assess differential functional associations.', 'Display the scatter plots with regression lines and print the correlation statistics to interpret the functional consequences of cell death pathway dysregulation.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import spearmanr

# Define the target cell types and the functional markers

Feedback:
Feedback on Analysis Plan:
• The plan clearly targets the novel hypothesis by focusing on relationships between cell death pathways and key immune functions (IFN1 and HLA1) in selected immune cell types, ensuring minimal overlap with prior analyses.
• It appropriately stratifies the analyses by disease status (COVID vs. Healthy) and cell type, aligning with guidelines on cell‐type specific investigations.
• Consider explicitly mentioning the incorporation of regression lines in the scatter plots to better visualize the correlation trends; this would strengthen the interpretation of the functional associations.
• Ensure to integrate these analyses with previous results by referencing the computed gene signature scores (apoptosis and pyroptosis) without re‐computing them if already present.

Feedback on Python Code for the First Step:
• The code correctly subsets cells by "cell_type_coarse" and iterates over the specified cell types, printing the number of cells processed per type.
• It separates the COVID and Healthy groups and computes Spearman correlations for apoptosis vs. IFN1 and pyroptosis vs. HLA1, which is in line with the analysis plan.
• While scatter plots are generated with appropriate labeling and coloring, the code does not include regression lines as mentioned in the analysis plan. Incorporating functions like seaborn’s lmplot or regplot (while ensuring the allowed packages compliance) could enhance visual interpretation.
• The use of conditional checks to ensure sufficient cell numbers in each group is excellent. Ensure these thresholds remain consistent across all steps.
• The coding style is clear and modular; however, adding comments or docstrings explaining the purpose of specific code blocks could improve readability.
• Overall, the code meets the guidelines and integrates well as a self-contained first step in the analysis, without duplicating earlier efforts.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current analysis examines correlations between various immune markers in different cell types, comparing COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Here's the feedback:

### Promising Results:
1. **CD4 T Cells:**
   - Strong correlation between Pyroptosis and HLA1 in both COVID-19 and healthy individuals (COVID: r = 0.301, p < 1e-100; Healthy: r = 0.297, p < 1e-50). This consistent association in both conditions suggests that Pyroptosis and HLA1 might be intertwined biologically, potentially playing a role in immune response regulation.

2. **CD14 Monocytes:**
   - Significant correlation between Pyroptosis and HLA1 in COVID-19 (r = 0.082, p < 1e-10) and healthy (r = 0.080, p < 0.001). This indicates a possible involvement in immune regulation during infection.

### Areas for Further Exploration:
1. **Interferon Response:**
   - Across all cell types, there's minimal correlation between Apoptosis and IFN1, especially in COVID-19 conditions. Explore whether this lack of association might suggest a decoupling of apoptosis from interferon response in the disease state, which could point towards alternative regulatory mechanisms during infection.

2. **CD8 T Cells:**
   - Despite lower correlation strengths, the increased significance in healthy (r = 0.125, p < 1e-10) compared to COVID-19 (r = 0.082, p = 3.283e-07) in Pyroptosis vs. HLA1 suggests different regulatory dynamics, potentially indicative of immune modulation.

### Future Steps:
1. **Differential Analysis:**
   - Perform differential expression or pathway enrichment for genes involved in Pyroptosis and HLA1. This could provide insights into pathways driving these correlations.

2. **Gene Set Enrichment:**
   - Utilize gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) to explore broader pathways involving apoptosis, pyroptosis, and interferon signaling.

3. **Intercellular Communication:**
   - Consider cell-cell communication analyses focusing on ligand-receptor interactions that may differ between COVID-19 and healthy scenarios, especially between monocytes and T cells.

4. **Time-Resolved Analysis:**
   - If longitudinal data is available, analyze these correlations over time to capture dynamic changes during infection progression.

5. **Comparison with Published Studies:**
   - Ensure these analyses provide novel insights beyond those presented in the provided paper, focusing on under-explored or newly identified pathways.

By following these steps, the research could uncover crucial insights into immune dysregulation and host-pathogen interactions in severe COVID-19, providing potential therapeutic targets.

Subpopulations within CD14 Monocytes and CD4 T cells defined by pyroptosis scores and HLA1 expression differentiate COVID‐19 from healthy conditions, potentially reflecting distinct cell states linked to dysregulated immune responses.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the anndata object for the promising cell types (CD14 Monocyte and CD4 T cells).', "For each cell type, extract the features 'score_pyroptosis' and 'HLA1' and recompute a k-nearest neighbor graph based on these features.", 'Perform Leiden clustering on the subset to identify subpopulations with distinct pyroptosis-HLA1 profiles.', 'Visualize the clusters using UMAP embedding colored by cluster labels and stratify cell distribution by disease status (COVID vs Healthy).', 'For each identified subcluster, compute the proportion of COVID versus Healthy cells and perform a Mann–Whitney U test to assess significant differences in the distribution of pyroptosis scores and HLA1 expression.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import mannwhitneyu

# Define the promising cell types based on previous results
promising_cell_types = ['CD14 Monocyte', 'CD4 T']

# Loop over each promising cell type
for cell in promising_cell_types:
    print(f"Processing {cell}...")
    # Subset the data for the specific cell type (using 'cell_type_coarse')
    adata_subset = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == cell].copy()
    
    # Create a new temporary AnnData object with only the features of interest
    # We use the pre-computed 'score_pyroptosis' and 'HLA1' from adata.obs
    # Add these as numerical features into adata_subset.obsm for clustering
    import pandas as pd
    features = adata_subset.obs[['score_pyroptosis', 'HLA1']].copy()

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan Feedback:
– The plan is clear, hypothesis‐driven, and distinct from previous analyses. It focuses on subsetting CD14 Monocytes and CD4 T cells using pyroptosis and HLA1 metrics, which is a novel angle relative to prior work.
– The multi‐step plan (subset, feature extraction, neighbors, Leiden clustering, UMAP visualization, group-specific Mann–Whitney U tests) is well outlined and aligns with the core goal.
– Consider adding a note on further characterizing clusters (e.g. differential expression within clusters) or adjusting for multiple comparisons in the statistical tests if many clusters are generated.
– The plan might also mention checking whether the number of cells in each subcluster remains sufficient for robust downstream analyses.
 
• First-Step Python Code Feedback:
– The code correctly subsets the anndata object for the specified cell types and extracts the “score_pyroptosis” and “HLA1” features. The overall flow is logical and consistent with the plan.
– Instead of re-importing pandas inside the loop, move that import to the top along with the other libraries to improve efficiency.
– Storing the features matrix in adata_subset.obsm['X_features'] is appropriate for computing the kNN graph. Ensure that downstream analyses consistently refer to this representation.
– The use of sc.pp.neighbors with a custom representation is well implemented; however, consider adding comments or parameter tuning for n_neighbors if sensitivity analysis is needed.
– The Leiden clustering and UMAP steps are performed sequentially. It could be beneficial to validate cluster stability across a range of resolution values.
– The code cleanly produces UMAP plots with subplots for Leiden clusters and disease status; just ensure show=False is used properly so that figures display in a grid as intended.
– The subsequent Mann–Whitney U tests are conditionally executed based on sample size, which is good practice. Consider including additional flags or logs if a significant number of clusters fall below the cell count threshold.

Overall, both the analysis plan and the code are well structured, focused on a novel angle, and follow the provided coding guidelines.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The analysis focuses on clustering CD14 monocytes and CD4 T cells based on pyroptosis and HLA1 expression, revealing potential dysregulated immune signaling mechanisms in severe COVID-19.

### Promising Results and Observations:

1. **Significant Clusters for Pyroptosis:**
   - **CD14 Monocytes:**
     - Clusters 22, 10, 2, and 23 show significant pyroptosis with low p-values, indicating potential engagement in inflammatory responses related to COVID-19.
   - **CD4 T Cells:**
     - Clusters 6 and 9 also exhibit significant pyroptosis, which may suggest their active role in the immune response during infection.

2. **Significant Clusters for HLA1:**
   - **CD14 Monocytes:**
     - Clusters 19, 0, 15, and 3 have low p-values for HLA1, indicating altered antigen presentation dynamics in response to the disease.
   - **CD4 T Cells:**
     - Cluster 2 shows low p-values for HLA1, suggesting differences in antigen presentation, possibly altering immune recognition.

3. **UMAP Visualization:**
   - The separation of disease vs. healthy status in UMAP plots supports the distinct immunological landscapes between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls.

### Recommendations for Future Steps:

1. **Further Differential Expression Analysis:**
   - Dive deeper into the differentially expressed genes within significant clusters to uncover specific pathways or cytokines involved, enhancing understanding of immune mechanisms.

2. **Pathway Enrichment:**
   - Perform enrichment analysis on the significant clusters to identify pathways or biological processes potentially mediating these responses.

3. **Inter-cluster Communication Analysis:**
   - Investigate potential ligand-receptor interactions between significant clusters to understand how enhanced signaling between cell types may contribute to disease pathology.

4. **Integration with Clinical Data:**
   - Correlate these findings with clinical parameters such as disease severity, time post-onset, and treatment to determine clinical relevance and potential therapeutic insights.

5. **Validation in Larger Cohorts:**
   - Validate these findings in larger datasets or through experimental methods to ensure robustness and generalizability.

These steps should help validate the hypothesis that immune signaling in severe COVID-19 involves dysregulated interactions between cell types, contributing to immunopathology.

You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Within immune cell subpopulations exhibiting high pyroptosis activity, severe COVID-19 drives a distinct gene expression profile that implicates novel inflammatory and regulatory pathways.

Analysis Plan:
['For each promising cell type (CD14 Monocyte and CD4 T), subset the cells to focus on those exhibiting high pyroptosis (i.e., cells with a score above the median) to enrich for dysregulated subpopulations.', 'Perform differential expression analysis between COVID-19 and Healthy groups in these high pyroptosis cells using sc.tl.rank_genes_groups with the Wilcoxon test.', 'Visualize the top 10 differentially expressed genes per group with a heatmap to uncover unique transcriptional signatures.', 'Summarize the top marker genes for each condition to highlight potential novel pathways associated with dysregulated immune responses in severe COVID-19.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define promising cell types for further analysis
promising_cell_types = ['CD14 Monocyte', 'CD4 T']

# Loop through each cell type to focus on high pyroptosis cells and perform DE analysis
for cell in promising_cell_types:
    print(f"Processing {cell}...")
    # Subset the data to the specific cell type
    adata_subset = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == cell].copy()
    
    # Identify cells with high pyroptosis activity (above median)
    median_pyr = np.median(adata_subset.obs['score_pyroptosis'])
    high_pyr_cells = adata_subset.obs['score_pyroptosis'] > median_pyr
    adata_high = adata_subset[high_pyr_cells].copy()
    print(f"{cell}: {adata_high.n_obs} cells with high pyroptosis score (above median)")
    
    # Perform differential expression analysis comparing COVID versus Healthy using the Wilcoxon test
    sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata_high, groupby='Status', method='wilcoxon', key_added='de_results')
    
    # Plot heatmap of top 10 differentially expressed genes for each group
    sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap(adata_high, groupby='Status', key='de_results', n_genes=10, show=True)
    
    # Print a summary of the top 5 genes for each condition
    de_res = adata_high.uns['de_results']
    status_groups = adata_high.obs['Status'].unique()
    for group in status_groups:
        top5 = de_res['names'][group][:5]
        print(f"Top 5 DE genes in {cell} for {group}:", top5)


Feedback:
1. Analysis plan feedback:
 • The hypothesis and plan are clearly defined, focusing on high pyroptosis within key immune cell types to uncover novel regulatory pathways. 
 • The step‐wise approach (subsetting, DE analysis via Wilcoxon, heatmap visualization, and marker summary) is logical and distinct from past analyses.
 • Consider adding explicit checks for balanced group sizes (COVID vs. Healthy) before running DE analysis to ensure robustness.
 • It may be beneficial to mention any correction for multiple testing in downstream DE interpretation.

2. Code feedback:
 • The code correctly subsets cells by cell type and high pyroptosis score, then calculates the median and selects cells above it – this meets the analysis goal.
 • Using sc.tl.rank_genes_groups with the Wilcoxon test is appropriate; however, verify that the “Status” metadata is well‐balanced after subsetting to avoid issues.
 • The heatmap visualization (sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap) and printing of top 5 genes per group are well implemented.
 • Ensure that the DE results object (adata_high.uns['de_results']) has the expected structure for multiple groups; adding error-handling or checks might improve robustness.
 • Code adheres to the allowed package usage and avoids external dependencies.
Overall, the analysis plan and initial step code are solid, clear, and align with the novel focus on pyroptosis, with minor suggestions for added robustness in group checking and multiple testing considerations.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results indicate significant differential expression (DE) patterns between COVID-19 and healthy individuals in both CD14 Monocytes and CD4 T cells, highlighting potential pathways involved in severe COVID-19:

1. **CD14 Monocytes:**
   - COVID-19 patients show upregulation of innate immune response genes, particularly S100A8 and S100A9, which are associated with inflammatory responses.
   - Healthy individuals demonstrate upregulation of genes like HLA-DRB1, associated with antigen presentation, suggesting functional modulation in antigen presentation in COVID-19.

2. **CD4 T Cells:**
   - DE genes in COVID-19 cells include IFI44L and SOCS3, indicating active interferon response and negative regulation of cytokine signaling, respectively.
   - Healthy cells show upregulation of mitochondrial genes, possibly indicating differences in metabolic state or stress.

3. **Pyroptosis Scores:**
   - Significant numbers of cells in both groups exhibit high pyroptosis scores, which could relate to the inflammatory cascade characteristic of COVID-19.

### Future Steps:

- **Validation and Pathway Analysis:**
  - Validate DE findings with alternative methods like qPCR or expand the analysis using pathway enrichment tools to identify significant pathways.

- **Ligand-Receptor Interaction Analysis:**
  - Focus on ligand-receptor interactions to explore hypothesized communication changes between monocytes and T cells, particularly involving pro-inflammatory cytokines.

- **Correlation with Clinical Data:**
  - Correlate gene expression data with clinical parameters or outcomes to decipher the relevance of these findings in disease severity.

- **Broader Cell Type Analysis:**
  - Include other immune cell types and look for transcriptional shifts and inter-cellular communication changes.

This analysis is promising as it provides insights into inflammatory and metabolic pathways that may contribute to severe COVID-19. Further detailed analysis could reveal targets for therapeutic intervention.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Severe COVID‐19 differentially modulates apoptosis and pyroptosis gene signature scores in key immune cell types (CD14 Monocytes, CD4 T, and CD8 T), and these differences can be statistically validated when stratified by disease status.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the adata.obs dataframe for each immune cell type of interest (CD14 Monocyte, CD4 T, CD8 T).', 'For each cell type, aggregate the precomputed apoptosis and pyroptosis scores along with their corresponding disease status (COVID and Healthy).', 'Compute summary statistics (median, interquartile range) for each score within each group.', 'Visualize the score distributions using combined boxplots and swarm plots for a clearer depiction of variability across disease statuses.', 'Perform Mann–Whitney U tests to statistically compare the distributions of each score between COVID and Healthy groups for every cell type and print the test statistics and p-values.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy.stats import mannwhitneyu

# Define target cell types
target_cell_types = ['CD14 Monocyte', 'CD4 T', 'CD8 T']

# Set up a figure with 3 rows and 2 columns (each row for one cell type, first column for apoptosis and second for pyroptosis)
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=len(target_cell_types), ncols=2, figsize=(12, 4 * len(target_cell_types)))

# Loop over each cell type and perform stratified analysis
for i, cell_type in enumerate(target_cell_types):
    # Subset the obs dataframe for the current cell type
    df = adata.obs[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == cell_type].copy()
    if df.empty:
        print(f"No cells found for cell type: {cell_type}")
        continue
    
    # For each score, plot a boxplot and overlay with a swarm plot to show all points
    for j, score in enumerate(['score_apoptosis', 'score_pyroptosis']):
        ax = axes[i, j] if len(target_cell_types) > 1 else axes[j]

            print(f"{cell_type} - {score}: Mann–Whitney U = {stat:.2f}, p-value = {p_val:.3e}")
        else:

plt.show()

Feedback:
Feedback on the First-Step Code:
• The code correctly subsets adata.obs by each target cell type and plots both apoptosis and pyroptosis scores by 'Status' using boxplots with overlaid swarm plots.
• It properly handles cases with insufficient cells by checking group sizes before performing the Mann–Whitney U test, which is good practice.
• The use of the axes grid with flexible indexing (adjusting for a single cell type if needed) is thoughtful, and the annotation of test statistics on the plots adds clarity.
• Consider calculating and printing summary statistics (e.g., median and interquartile range) within each group—this would more fully address the analysis plan and help quantify the score distributions.
• Although the code meets the package restrictions, integrating these summary stats (perhaps as additional text on the plots or via a separate printed table) would provide more comprehensive insights.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is clearly defined, focusing on a novel test of differential modulation of apoptosis and pyroptosis signatures across key immune cell types.
• The approach to stratify by disease status and statistically compare the groups using non-parametric tests (Mann–Whitney U) is appropriate.
• Ensure that summary statistics (median, IQR) are computed and reported alongside the visualizations as proposed.
• The plan is well aligned with the hypothesis and makes good use of the available metadata; it avoids repetition of earlier analyses by focusing on gene signature scores.
• In future steps, consider incorporating additional quality control metrics or complementary visualization methods (e.g., density plots) to further validate the robustness of the patterns observed.

Overall, the code and plan are well constructed, and a few additional summary statistic calculations would further strengthen the analysis.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results presented show differential scoring of apoptosis and pyroptosis pathways between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Here are some insights and suggestions for future steps in the analysis:

1. **Evaluate Biological Relevance**:
   - **Apoptosis and Pyroptosis**: Both are forms of programmed cell death, but pyroptosis is more inflammatory. Observations of differential scores may indicate an altered inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients.
   - **Relevance to Cytokine Storm**: Increased pyroptosis could contribute to the cytokine storm observed in severe COVID-19. Investigating further could link these findings to disease pathology.

2. **Correlate with Clinical Data**:
   - Integrate these scores with available clinical data such as ventilation status or severity of disease to see if higher scores correlate with worse outcomes.

3. **Differentiate Between Cell Types**:
   - **Cell Type-Specific Scores**: Analyze these pathways within specific immune cell populations (e.g., monocytes, T-cells) to identify which cells drive these alterations.

4. **Temporal Analysis**:
   - If possible, perform a temporal analysis to see how these scores vary over time in the course of the disease.

5. **Validate Findings with Additional Analyses**:
   - Conduct differential expression analysis of key apoptosis and pyroptosis genes to validate pathway score findings.
   - Use pathway enrichment or gene set enrichment analysis to further understand the pathways active in these cells.

6. **Explore Mechanistic Links**:
   - Investigate upstream regulators or signaling events that might lead to increased apoptosis/pyroptosis in immune cells.

7. **Comparison with Other Findings**:
   - Compare these results with the previous findings about immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19, specifically focusing on the links between interferon and cell death pathways.

8. **Explore Therapeutic Implications**:
   - If pathways are significantly altered, consider investigating potential therapeutic interventions that could mitigate such dysregulation.

This analysis provides promising insights into cell death mechanisms in COVID-19 and can be leveraged for a deeper understanding or potential intervention strategies.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
In severe COVID‐19, clinical severity metrics such as ventilation status and days post-symptom onset (DPS) are associated with differential activation of programmed cell death pathways (apoptosis and pyroptosis) in key immune cell types.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the dataset for key immune cell types (CD14 Monocyte, CD4 T, and CD8 T) in COVID patients.', 'For each cell type, evaluate how apoptosis and pyroptosis scores correlate with clinical severity metrics (ventilation status and DPS).', 'Perform scatter plot analyses with regression fits to assess correlations between DPS and the death signature scores using Spearman correlation, printing the correlation coefficients and p-values.', 'Generate violin plots comparing the distribution of apoptosis and pyroptosis scores across ventilation status groups (Vent, NonVent) within COVID patients.', 'Interpret the statistical significance of these associations to further understand the clinical relevance of altered cell death programs.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import spearmanr, mannwhitneyu

# Define key immune cell types for analysis
cell_types = ['CD14 Monocyte', 'CD4 T', 'CD8 T']

# Loop over each cell type and perform correlation and group comparisons within COVID patients
for cell in cell_types:
    # Subset data to the specific cell type and COVID patients only
    adata_subset = adata[(adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == cell) & (adata.obs['Status'] == 'COVID')].copy()
    if adata_subset.n_obs < 10:
        print(f"{cell}: Insufficient COVID cells for robust analysis (n={adata_subset.n_obs}). Skipping...")
        continue

    print(f"\nProcessing {cell} ({adata_subset.n_obs} COVID cells)")

    # Scatter plots and Spearman correlation for DPS vs. cell death scores
    for score in ['score_apoptosis', 'score_pyroptosis']:

        sns.regplot(x=adata_subset.obs['DPS'], y=adata_subset.obs[score], scatter=False, color='red')
        plt.xlabel('Days Post-Symptom Onset (DPS)')
        plt.ylabel(score)

    # Here, the 'Ventilated' column in COVID samples is expected to be either 'Vent' or 'NonVent'
    groups = adata_subset.obs['Ventilated'].unique()
    for score in ['score_apoptosis', 'score_pyroptosis']:
        plt.figure(figsize=(6,5))

        plt.title(f"{cell}: {score} by Ventilation Status")
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.show()
        
        # Perform Mann-Whitney U test between Vent and NonVent groups if both groups have sufficient cells
        if 'Vent' in groups and 'NonVent' in groups:
            vent_scores = adata_subset.obs.loc[adata_subset.obs['Ventilated'] == 'Vent', score]
            nonvent_scores = adata_subset.obs.loc[adata_subset.obs['Ventilated'] == 'NonVent', score]
            if (len(vent_scores) >= 3) and (len(nonvent_scores) >= 3):
                stat, p = mannwhitneyu(vent_scores, nonvent_scores, alternative='two-sided')
                print(f"{cell} - {score} (Vent vs NonVent): U statistic = {stat:.2f}, p-value = {p:.3e}")
            else:
                print(f"{cell} - Not enough cells in one or both ventilation groups for {score} statistical comparison.")

Feedback:
Feedback on the First Step Code:
• Overall, the code clearly subsets COVID cells by key immune cell type and then computes correlations and group‐wise comparisons using DPS and the death signature scores. Using Spearman correlation and Mann–Whitney U tests is appropriate, and the inclusion of minimum‐cell count checks is a good practice.
• The code adheres to the allowed packages and coding guidelines by using Scanpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, and SciPy. It also leverages adata.obs correctly without reloading the data.
• One suggestion is to consider combining multiple similar scatter plots into grid layouts when feasible—instead of displaying each figure separately—so that multiple correlation analyses can be visually compared in a single view. This may be beneficial for summaries or publication‐grade figures.
• When using sc.pl.violin for the ventilation comparison, the code assumes that “Ventilated” already distinguishes COVID cells from healthy ones. It might be useful to double-check that ‘Healthy’ cells are entirely excluded in that subset or include a brief comment for clarity.
• Adding inline comments to note the rationale behind plotting DPS versus death scores would further contextualize the analysis for reproducibility.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is well focused on the central hypothesis—evaluating the relationship between clinical severity metrics (DPS, ventilation status) and activation of programmed cell death pathways in key immune cell types.
• It is distinct from the previously published analyses, as it emphasizes correlation with clinical metrics and splits the analysis by specific immune cell types not addressed in the prior attempts.
• The steps are logically ordered (subsetting, correlation scatter plots with regression, group comparisons via violin plots and statistical tests) and match the hypothesis.
• One potential improvement is to consider integrating summary figures (e.g., grid arrangements of scatter plots or systematic side-by-side violin plots) to provide an overall view across cell types. This would reinforce comparisons across groups and streamline figure interpretation.
• Lastly, ensure that each analysis cell remains self-contained while building on the previous computations, which the plan and code accomplish.

Overall, the code and plan are well aligned with the hypothesis, adhere to the guidelines, and offer a clear, methodical approach to exploring programmed cell death in severe COVID‐19.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results reveal some interesting patterns that could further support the hypothesis and guide next steps:

1. **CD14 Monocytes:**
   - **Pyroptosis:** The Spearman correlation between DPS and score_pyroptosis is significant (p = 2.861e-03). This suggests a relationship worth exploring, as pyroptosis might play a role in the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19. The difference between ventilated and non-ventilated patients in pyroptosis scores (p = 2.388e-12) is also significant, indicating a potential association with disease severity.
   - **Actionable Step:** Further investigate the biological implications of increased pyroptosis in CD14 monocytes. Consider deeper analysis into genes or pathways driving pyroptosis in relation to ventilation status.

2. **CD4 T Cells:**
   - **Apoptosis and Pyroptosis:** Both scores show significant correlations with DPS (p-values < 0.0001), and there are significant differences between ventilated and non-ventilated patients in both apoptosis and pyroptosis scores.
   - **Actionable Step:** Delve into why these correlations are present and what they might mean for T cell function or exhaustion. Explore the gene expression profiles of these cells to understand the biological relevance.

3. **CD8 T Cells:**
   - There appears to be little correlation between DPS and apoptosis or pyroptosis. However, significant differences exist in pyroptosis scores between ventilated and non-ventilated patients (p = 0.037).
   - **Actionable Step:** Consider the role of CD8 T cells pyroptosis in disease progression and its potential linkage to ventilation requirements.

### Future Directions:

- **Pathway Analysis:** For cell types demonstrating significant results (CD14 monocytes and CD4 T cells), consider conducting pathway enrichment analysis to identify key drivers behind these responses.
- **Gene Expression Profiles:** Examine differential expression, focusing on genes involved in apoptosis and pyroptosis, to uncover mechanisms that might explain observed correlations.
- **Cell-Cell Communication:** Given the research paper's emphasis on monocyte and T cell interactions, attempt to connect the dots between pyroptosis/apoptosis signaling and potential ligand-receptor interactions through computational modeling.
  
By refining the approach and focusing on these promising directions, the analysis might uncover new insights about immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19.

PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps.

Here are the previous analyses attempted:
In severe COVID‐19 patients, key immune cells (particularly CD14 Monocytes and dendritic cells) exhibit stronger coordination between antigen presentation (HLA1) and interferon response (IFN1) compared to healthy controls, suggesting dysregulated immune signaling that could contribute to disease severity.
In severe COVID-19, prolonged disease duration (reflected by higher DPS values) is associated with increased mitochondrial stress in adaptive immune cells (specifically CD4 T and CD8 T cells), suggesting that extended immune activation leads to metabolic dysregulation.
In severe COVID-19, immune cells—particularly T cells and monocytes—exhibit altered ribosomal content, which may reflect a dysregulated translation machinery that is coupled with an enhanced interferon response.
In severe COVID‐19, platelets exhibit sex-specific transcriptional differences in genes related to activation and coagulation, potentially contributing to the clinically observed differences in thrombotic risk between males and females.
Severe COVID-19 is associated with increased transcriptional heterogeneity in immune cells, reflecting dysregulated gene expression control. This analysis tests whether individual cells from COVID patients exhibit higher variance in gene expression compared to healthy controls.
NK cells in severe COVID‐19 patients exhibit an increased exhaustion gene signature compared to healthy controls, potentially reflecting impaired cytotoxic function. This analysis will leverage established markers (PDCD1, LAG3, TIGIT, HAVCR2, CTLA4) and may be extended with additional markers to robustly capture the exhaustion phenotype.
Severe COVID‐19 leads to dysregulation of programmed cell death pathways in peripheral immune cells, resulting in increased variability and a decoupling of apoptotic and pyroptotic gene expression programs compared to healthy individuals.


Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
The paper focuses on severe COVID-19, a condition induced by SARS‑CoV‑2 infection that, in a subset of patients, progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.

Biological background  
Key biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.

Paper’s computational analyses  
A series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: Dendritic cells in severe COVID‐19 patients exhibit altered coordination between the expression of ribosomal protein genes and key inflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL6, TNF) compared to healthy individuals, suggesting a reconfiguration of translational control under inflammatory stress.

Analysis Plan:
1. Subset the dataset to isolate dendritic cells using the 'cell_type_coarse' metadata.
2. Identify ribosomal protein genes by filtering the gene names that start with 'RPL' or 'RPS' and compute an average ribosomal expression score for each dendritic cell.
3. Extract the expression profiles for key inflammatory cytokine genes (IL1B, IL6, TNF) in the dendritic cell subset.
4. Divide the dendritic cell data by disease status (COVID vs Healthy) based on the 'Status' column.
5. For each disease group and each cytokine, compute Pearson correlation coefficients between the ribosomal score and cytokine expression levels, and print the results.
6. Use Fisher's Z-transformation to statistically compare the correlation differences between COVID and Healthy groups, and visualize the results with a grid of scatter plots overlaid with regression lines and annotated with correlation coefficients.

Initial Code:
import scanpy as sc
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Subset to dendritic cells (DC) using 'cell_type_coarse' annotation
dc_cells = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'DC'].copy()

# Ensure gene names are strings
gene_names = dc_cells.var_names.astype(str)

# Identify ribosomal genes starting with 'RPL' or 'RPS'
ribosomal_genes = [gene for gene in gene_names if gene.startswith('RPL') or gene.startswith('RPS')]

# Convert the expression matrix to a dense numpy array if necessary
if hasattr(dc_cells.X, 'toarray'):
    expr_matrix = dc_cells.X.toarray()
else:
    expr_matrix = dc_cells.X

# Create a DataFrame with gene names as columns for easier processing
expr_df = pd.DataFrame(expr_matrix, index=dc_cells.obs_names, columns=gene_names)

# Compute the average ribosomal expression per cell as a score
if ribosomal_genes:
    dc_cells.obs['ribosomal_score'] = expr_df[ribosomal_genes].mean(axis=1)
else:
    dc_cells.obs['ribosomal_score'] = np.nan

# Display the first few entries of the computed ribosomal scores
print('Dendritic cells with computed ribosomal scores:')
print(dc_cells.obs[['ribosomal_score']].head())

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Dendritic cells in severe COVID‐19 patients exhibit altered coordination between the expression of ribosomal protein genes and key inflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL6, TNF) compared to healthy individuals, suggesting a reconfiguration of translational control under inflammatory stress.

Analysis Plan:
["Subset the dataset to isolate dendritic cells using the 'cell_type_coarse' metadata.", "Identify ribosomal protein genes by filtering the gene names that start with 'RPL' or 'RPS' and compute an average ribosomal expression score for each dendritic cell.", 'Extract the expression profiles for key inflammatory cytokine genes (IL1B, IL6, TNF) in the dendritic cell subset.', "Divide the dendritic cell data by disease status (COVID vs Healthy) based on the 'Status' column.", 'For each disease group and each cytokine, compute Pearson correlation coefficients between the ribosomal score and cytokine expression levels, and print the results.', "Use Fisher's Z-transformation to statistically compare the correlation differences between COVID and Healthy groups, and visualize the results with a grid of scatter plots overlaid with regression lines and annotated with correlation coefficients."]

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Subset to dendritic cells (DC) using 'cell_type_coarse' annotation
dc_cells = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'DC'].copy()

# Convert the expression matrix to a dense numpy array if necessary
if hasattr(dc_cells.X, 'toarray'):
    expr_matrix = dc_cells.X.toarray()
else:
    expr_matrix = dc_cells.X

# Create a DataFrame with gene names as columns for easier processing

# Display the first few entries of the computed ribosomal scores
print('Dendritic cells with computed ribosomal scores:')
print(dc_cells.obs[['ribosomal_score']].head())

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python Code for Step 1:
• The code is clear and concise. It correctly subsets dendritic cells using the ‘cell_type_coarse’ field and safely converts the expression matrix to a dense array when needed.
• Converting the variable names to strings and filtering for ribosomal genes (those that start with 'RPL' or 'RPS') is handled well.
• Creating a DataFrame from the expression matrix aids readability and further manipulation; however, consider checking that the resulting DataFrame dimensions match expectations for added robustness.
• It might be useful to add an error or warning message if no ribosomal genes are found, so that downstream steps use appropriate data (currently defaults to NaN).
• Including a brief comment on the expected state (raw versus normalized data) could help in ensuring consistency for ratio-based scores.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is well-structured and directly tackles the stated hypothesis by examining the coordination between ribosomal gene expression and key inflammatory cytokines specifically in dendritic cells. This is a novel way to probe translational control under inflammatory stress.
• The step‐by‐step approach—subsetting, scoring, extracting cytokine profiles, stratifying by disease status, computing Pearson correlations, and comparing correlations with Fisher’s Z—is logical and leverages statistical analyses and visualization effectively.
• Ensure that downstream analyses incorporate quality control (e.g., using relevant metadata) so that any cell filtering inconsistencies do not affect the correlation results.
• The plan clearly distinguishes itself from previous analyses and from the paper’s approach, by focusing on interactions between ribosomal and inflammatory gene expression in DCs rather than the more common antigen presentation or interferon signatures.
• Overall, the plan is self-contained, adheres to the provided coding guidelines, and uses only the permitted packages.

Both the code and the plan are on target; minor improvements (such as adding explicit error handling and data status comments) can further enhance robustness and clarity.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: Dendritic cells in severe COVID‐19 patients exhibit altered coordination between ribosomal protein gene expression and key inflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL6, TNF) compared to healthy individuals, indicating that inflammatory stress may reconfigure translational control in these cells.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Subset the dataset to isolate dendritic cells using the 'cell_type_coarse' metadata and perform a quick quality control check on the dimensions of the resulting expression DataFrame.
2. Identify ribosomal protein genes by filtering for gene names starting with 'RPL' or 'RPS', and compute an average ribosomal expression score for each dendritic cell while ensuring the genes are present; raise a warning if none are found. Also, include a check that the expression matrix is in a normalized state (if applicable).
3. Extract the expression profiles for key inflammatory cytokine genes (IL1B, IL6, TNF) in the dendritic cell subset.
4. Stratify the dendritic cells by disease status (COVID vs Healthy) based on the 'Status' column.
5. For each disease group and each cytokine, compute Pearson correlation coefficients between the ribosomal score and cytokine expression levels, and print the results along with corresponding statistical tests.
6. Use Fisher's Z-transformation to statistically compare the correlation differences between COVID and Healthy groups, and visualize the results with a grid of scatter plots overlaid with regression lines and annotated with correlation coefficients.

Revised Code:

import numpy as np

# Convert the expression matrix to a dense numpy array if necessary
if hasattr(dc_cells.X, 'toarray'):

if expr_df.shape[0] != dc_cells.n_obs or expr_df.shape[1] != len(gene_names):

Feedback:

1. **Promising Results:**
   - The current analysis on ribosomal scores within dendritic cells provides new insights into the translational landscape of these cells in the context of severe COVID-19. Ribosomal content can reflect changes in cellular activity or stress responses, which are crucial under severe infection conditions.
   - The computed ribosomal scores suggest potential heterogeneity in translation activity, possibly linked to cellular stress responses or altered metabolic states in severe COVID-19.

2. **Iterate and Expand:**
   - **Broader Cell Type Analysis:** Consider calculating ribosomal scores across more immune cell subsets—such as monocytes, T cells, or NK cells—to determine if similar changes are evident across immune compartments, which could indicate a more systemic response.
   - **Integrate with Existing Hypotheses:** This translational data can be integrated with your previous hypothesis about altered ribosomal content and translational machinery dysregulation, helping confirm or refute being a feature of severe disease.
   - **Correlate with Other Features:** Examine correlations between ribosomal scores and other cellular features such as interferon response or HLA expression. This could uncover links between translation and immune signaling pathways.
   - **Longitudinal Analysis:** If timepoint data is available, perform a longitudinal study to see how ribosomal content changes over the disease course, potentially revealing temporal patterns tied to disease progression or treatment response.

3. **Biological Interpretation and Validation:**
   - **Biological Validation:** These computational observations should be paired with biological validation. Independent assays, such as polysome profiling or RNA FISH, could confirm changes in translation dynamics at the protein level.
   - **Functional Impact:** Assess the functional consequences of altered ribosomal content on dendritic cell functions like antigen presentation or cytokine production, which could elucidate how these changes might drive or modulate severe COVID-19 pathogenesis.

4. **Develop Hypotheses for Future Testing:**
   - Use these findings to formulate new hypotheses regarding the role of altered ribosomal content in immune dysregulation during severe COVID-19. For instance, hypothesize that changes in ribosomal scores impact cytokine production or cell survival under stress conditions.
   - Explore whether interventions aimed at modulating ribosomal function could mitigate immune dysfunction or serve as therapeutic targets in severe COVID-19.

By integrating ribosomal score analyses with broader immune dynamics and validating findings, you move closer to identifying mechanistic insights into immune responses in severe COVID-19.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Alterations in ribosomal protein gene expression in severe COVID‐19 are not confined to dendritic cells; they may be systematically observed across key immune cell subsets, potentially linked to immune activation and altered translational dynamics.

Analysis Plan:
['Define a list of immune cell types of interest (DC, CD14 Monocyte, CD16 Monocyte, CD4 T, CD8 T, NK).', "For each cell type, subset the data, identify ribosomal genes (those starting with 'RPL' or 'RPS'), check for normalization, and compute an average ribosomal expression score per cell.", 'Collate ribosomal scores along with cell type and disease status (COVID vs Healthy) into a unified DataFrame, and visualize the distribution of scores across cell types using a boxplot.']

Feedback:
• Code Feedback:
  - The function is well‐structured and modularized. One suggestion is to consider using Scanpy’s built-in scoring function (sc.tl.score_genes) for computing ribosomal scores. This would ensure consistency with established routines and automatically handle reference gene selection.
  - The heuristic for checking normalization (using max > 50) might be oversimplified; consider a more robust metric (e.g., per-cell library size distributions) before flagging normalization issues.
  - Converting the expression matrix to dense format might be problematic for large datasets. If subsets remain large, consider using sparse-aware operations or functions that handle sparse matrices directly.
  - Adding inline comments regarding why certain thresholds are chosen (e.g., the threshold of 50 for normalized data) could help reproducibility.
  - Ensure variable naming (e.g., "expr_df" and "ribosomal_genes") is consistently documented so that others clearly understand the processing workflow.

• Analysis Plan Feedback:
  - The plan is clear and focused on a novel hypothesis by broadening ribosomal gene analysis beyond dendritic cells. Specify statistical tests (e.g., Mann–Whitney U or permutation tests) to formally compare ribosomal scores between COVID and healthy samples within each cell type.
  - To enhance novelty, consider integrating additional visualization methods (e.g., overlaid violin and jitter plots) or alternative normalization assessments to better capture translational dynamics.
  - Since the plan targets multiple immune subsets, detail how potential batch effects or confounding factors (like donor variability) might be controlled.
  - Overall, the plan builds nicely on past analyses and provides a clear next step distinct from prior work while staying within the allowed packages and guidelines.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The analysis of ribosomal scores in different immune cell types from COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls provides some intriguing findings:

1. **Comparison with Previous Work**: 
   - This analysis differs from previous studies focused on transcriptional heterogeneity, cytokine expression, and immune exhaustion, adding a focus on ribosomal content as a potentially dysregulated aspect in severe COVID-19.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The distribution of ribosomal scores across cell types could suggest cell-specific differences in translational activity related to disease status.
   - CD14 Monocytes, CD16 Monocytes, and NK cells display a notable difference in scores between COVID-19 and healthy individuals, which aligns with known immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19. 

3. **Potential Hypotheses**:
   - Increased ribosomal scores in certain monocytes and immune cells might reflect elevated protein synthesis or stress responses, potentially correlating to interferon responses or inflammatory pathways.
   - Mapping these observations with cytokine expression data from previous analyses could uncover links between translation machinery and immune signaling in COVID-19.

4. **Future Steps & Validation**:
   - Further statistical testing is necessary to validate whether differences in ribosomal scores are significant and biologically meaningful.
   - Integrating other datasets like mitochondrial stress markers and transcriptomic signatures could deepen understanding of the ribosomal role in immune dysregulation.
   - Expanding the analysis to include DE of ribosomal genes themselves to verify translational regulation levels.

5. **Distinct Analysis Considerations**:
   - This analysis should continue emphasizing contrasts not heavily pursued in prior work, such as non-canonical cell types or unique ribosomal gene sets.
   - Exploring the temporal aspect of ribosomal score changes across disease progression stages could provide new insights into how translational activity evolves with disease severity.

In conclusion, this initial analysis is promising, offering a new perspective on immune alteration in severe COVID-19 by focusing on the translational machinery. Expanding the analysis could uncover novel pathways linked to immune responses and disease pathogenesis.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
In dendritic cells from severe COVID‐19 patients, the average expression of key inflammatory cytokine genes (IL1B, IL6, TNF) will positively correlate with the ribosomal score, and this relationship may intensify with increasing DPS, suggesting that translational machinery and inflammation coordinate dynamically over disease progression.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset dendritic cells from the anndata object.', 'Extract the expression profiles for the cytokines IL1B, IL6, and TNF, and compute an inflammatory score (average expression) for each cell.', "Merge the inflammatory score with the previously computed ribosomal score and stratify cells by 'Status' (COVID vs Healthy).", 'Perform Pearson correlation analysis between the ribosomal and inflammatory scores for each disease group, displaying regression lines and annotating correlation coefficients and p-values.', 'Explore the association between the inflammatory score and DPS (days post symptom) to assess temporal dynamics.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy import stats

# Subset to dendritic cells using 'cell_type_coarse' annotation
dc_cells = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'DC'].copy()

# Ensure gene names are strings
gene_names = dc_cells.var_names.astype(str)

# Define cytokine genes of interest
cytokine_genes = [gene for gene in ['IL1B', 'IL6', 'TNF'] if gene in gene_names]
if not cytokine_genes:
    print('Warning: Cytokine genes (IL1B, IL6, TNF) not found in the dataset for dendritic cells.')
else:
    # Convert expression matrix to a dense format if necessary
    if hasattr(dc_cells.X, 'toarray'):
        expr_matrix = dc_cells.X.toarray()

Feedback:
Feedback on the First Step Code:
• The code appropriately subsets dendritic cells using the 'cell_type_coarse' annotation and safely handles sparse matrices by converting to a dense format when needed. This ensures broad compatibility with different adata.X representations.
• Using a list comprehension to identify cytokine genes ensures that only available genes are used. However, it might be beneficial to log which cytokine genes were found to help in later interpretations.
• The conversion of the expression matrix into a DataFrame is a clear and effective approach; however, ensure that gene ordering remains consistent when computing the mean across the cytokine genes.
• The integration of a check for the prior existence of 'ribosomal_score' in the metadata is good practice, reinforcing that subsequent analysis steps rely on upstream computations.
• The plotting strategy uses both scatter and regression plots stratified by 'Status'. Consider adding grid lines or a unified legend configuration to ensure that overlapping legends from scatterplot and regplot are well managed.
• When exploring the relationship between inflammatory_score and DPS, the code correctly checks for the presence of the 'DPS' column; a similar check might also be applied to the 'Status' column if variability in metadata is anticipated.
• Overall, variable names and comments are clear. Including docstrings for functions (if any) and slightly more detailed inline comments for statistical testing (i.e., the rationale for Pearson correlation) could improve reproducibility.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The hypothesis is clearly stated and distinct from previous tests, focusing on the interplay between inflammatory cytokine expression, ribosomal content, and DPS. This adds a novel dynamic aspect to the analysis.
• The step-by-step plan is logically organized: from subsetting dendritic cells, computing scores for cytokine genes and ribosomal genes, to stratifying patients by disease status. This gives a clear pathway from raw data to correlation analysis.
• Since previous analyses have explored correlations regarding ribosomal genes and other metadata (e.g., mitochondrial stress), ensure that this analysis maintains its novelty by explicitly focusing on the dynamic interplay during disease progression (temporal DPS analysis).
• Consider integrating additional statistical tests for correlation beyond Pearson (e.g., Spearman) if the relationship appears nonlinear. This could provide additional insights into the inflammatory-translational dynamics.
• In later analysis steps, combining figures into a grid will improve the visualization clarity when multiple plots are presented together.
• Make sure that the planned workflow is self-contained and builds on previous data manipulations (i.e., using precomputed ribosomal scores) to minimize redundancy.
• Overall, the plan is concise and well-aligned with the guidelines. The focus on dendritic cells and inflammatory cytokines in the context of disease progression offers a novel perspective that complements but does not overlap with earlier work.

Both the code and analysis plan adhere well to the provided guidelines and leverage the available metadata effectively.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.
