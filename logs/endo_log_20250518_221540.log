PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/endo_data.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps. 

You are given the following summary of the anndata object:

Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
This study focuses on the human endometrium—a dynamic tissue that undergoes cyclical remodeling, shedding, and regeneration during the menstrual cycle. These dramatic transformations are central to reproductive physiology, as they underlie fertility and the establishment of a receptive state for embryo implantation known as the window of implantation (WOI). The biological background of the study is rooted in understanding how different cell types within the endometrium change their gene expression profiles over the cycle, how these changes regulate tissue homeostasis, and how failures or deviations in these processes might be linked to fertility issues and endometrial diseases.

Biological background  
Relevant biological questions include deciphering the molecular signatures that define each phase of the menstrual cycle, particularly the abrupt transcriptional activation that marks the opening of the WOI. The investigation also centers on the mechanisms behind cellular differentiation, decidualization of stromal fibroblasts, and the interplay among various cell types—including ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells, stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells, and smooth muscle cells. This enhanced resolution of cellular heterogeneity paves the way for better understanding of normal reproductive physiology and provides a baseline reference for studying endometrial pathologies.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors began their investigation by applying dimensional reduction techniques (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, or t-SNE, and uniform manifold approximation, UMAP) on single-cell RNA sequencing data generated using the Fluidigm C1 platform and validated with the 10x Chromium system. They analyzed 2,148 cells from 19 healthy donors, identifying clear segregation into distinct groups. Differential expression analysis and density-based clustering revealed six major cell types—stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, unciliated epithelium, and a previously uncharacterized ciliated epithelium. In the 10x dataset of over 71,000 cells, an additional smooth muscle cell type was uncovered. The identification and characterization of these cell types, using canonical markers and newly discovered discriminatory genes (e.g., those marking ciliated epithelium), provide a comprehensive cellular atlas of the endometrium.

Paper’s computational analyses  
Next, the study employed a mutual information (MI)–based approach to build a pseudotime trajectory that connected cellular transcriptomic states across the menstrual cycle within the major endometrial cell types. By selecting “time-associated” genes, the researchers generated principal curves in t-SNE space to order cells along a continuous trajectory. This analysis revealed four distinct phases for both unciliated epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts. A striking finding was that unciliated epithelia displayed an abrupt, discontinuous transition in gene expression—marked by a rapid activation of a specific gene module that includes PAEP, GPX3, and CXCL14—corresponding to the opening of the WOI. In contrast, stromal fibroblasts showed a more gradual transition with modular upregulation of decidualization markers, underscoring different dynamics in epithelial versus stromal compartment transitions.

Paper’s computational analyses  
Further detailed analyses focused on unraveling finer cellular heterogeneity and regulatory mechanisms. The unciliated epithelium was deconvoluted into glandular and luminal subtypes based on differential expression of genes such as WNT7A, LGR5, and FOXA2; these markers correspond to previously documented differences in anatomical function and remodeling during the cycle. Additionally, the study characterized global transcription factor dynamics and secreted protein profiles by clustering dynamically expressed genes in both cell types. The team applied gene ontology enrichment to relate these expression patterns to processes like differentiation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and morphogenesis. Parallel cell cycle analyses using canonical G1/S and G2/M gene sets helped identify proliferative versus secretory phases, confirming that the transition from a high-cycling state to a quiescent, receptive state occurs between phases in both epithelia and stromal fibroblasts, thereby linking transcriptomic signatures with histological observations.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises multi-platform single-cell transcriptomic profiles derived from human endometrial biopsies collected from healthy ovum donors during a natural menstrual cycle. Specifically, 19 donors contributed samples to the Fluidigm C1 dataset (2,148 cells), while an independent validation set of ten donors was profiled using the 10x Chromium system (over 71,000 cells). Alongside cell-type–specific gene expression counts, the dataset includes metadata such as day of menstrual cycle, phase assignments based on both transcriptomic and histological criteria, and spatial data from RNAscope and immunofluorescence imaging. This rich combinatorial dataset connects molecular signatures to key reproductive events like the WOI and decidualization, serving as an essential resource for understanding normal endometrial physiology and providing a baseline for future studies on endometrial diseases and fertility treatments.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: Endometrial macrophages transition from a pro-inflammatory (M1-like) state in the early menstrual days to an anti-inflammatory (M2-like) state in the late secretory phase, reflected by a systematic shift in M1 and M2 gene-set activity scores across cycle day.

Analysis Plan:
1. Subset the AnnData object to macrophage cells (adata.obs['cell_type'] == 'Macrophages') and obtain an overview of cell counts per menstrual day and per sequencing platform to ensure adequate sampling across conditions.
2. Compute single-cell M1 and M2 activation scores using curated gene lists (e.g. M1: IL1B, TNF, CXCL10, NOS2; M2: MRC1, CD163, IL10, ARG1) with sc.tl.score_genes, store the scores in adata.obs, and visualize their distribution on a UMAP embedding coloured by day.
3. Quantify the relationship between cycle day and activation state by calculating, for each cell, an activation index = M2_score – M1_score, and then performing a Spearman rank correlation between activation index and day; additionally run a linear mixed-effects model with donor as a random effect (implemented via scipy’s stats.linregress within each donor and then combining with a meta-analysis z-test) to control for inter-donor variability.
4. Stratify the macrophage population by sequencing platform (C1 vs 10x) and repeat the correlation analysis to confirm that the observed trend is robust to technical batches; visualize platform-specific trends with violin plots of activation index by early (days 4–10), mid (11–15), and late (16–20) bins.
5. Identify the top genes driving the early-to-late shift by ranking genes whose expression correlates (Spearman) with activation index (|ρ| > 0.3, FDR < 0.05) and display the leading 20 genes in a dotplot heatmap; perform GO term enrichment on this gene set (optional exploratory step using pre-annotated GO terms stored in adata.var if available).
6. Summarize results in a multi-panel figure: (i) macrophage count per day, (ii) UMAP coloured by activation index, (iii) scatter plot of activation index vs day with regression line and Spearman ρ, (iv) violin plots stratified by platform, and (v) dotplot of top correlated genes.

Feedback:
Feedback on analysis plan
• Hypothesis and overall workflow are novel w.r.t. the manuscript and previous attempts; focusing on macrophage M1↔M2 dynamics is appropriate.  
• Step-order is logical, but statistical modeling needs tightening:
  – Mixed-effects suggestion via “per-donor linregress + meta-analysis z-test” is vague; scipy lacks a ready meta-analysis. Either (i) aggregate to donor-level means and run a single Spearman/linear regression (preferred, avoids pseudoreplication) or (ii) implement a fixed-effects meta using inverse-variance weighting (requires computing SE of slopes). Clarify which route you will code.  
  – Consider non-parametric trend test across ordered day bins (e.g. Jonckheere–Terpstra) as a platform-robust corroboration; it can be written with scipy ranks.  
• Define day variable explicitly as numeric; if some donors have multiple days, describe how you’ll handle repeated measures.  
• Step 4: give exact platform labels present in adata.obs['dataset'] ('10x', 'C1') and ensure each has sufficient day coverage before stratified tests; otherwise down-sample or report caveats.  
• Step 5: specify multiple-testing correction method (Benjamini–Hochberg). You can implement it manually with scipy.stats.rankdata; no external library needed.  
• Optional GO enrichment will likely fail: adata.var rarely stores GO terms. Either drop or replace with simple over-representation of cytokine / chemotaxis keywords present in gene symbols.  
• Include a QC checkpoint after subsetting (number of genes, counts per cell) to confirm that processing steps done earlier (normalization, log1p) are still valid for the subset.  
• Multi-panel figure: sketch panel layout (e.g. gridspec 2×3) to ensure consistent sizing.  


Feedback on first-step Python code
Functional
✓ Subsetting, basic counts, and gene-set scoring are correct and respect package constraints.

Improvements / issues
1. Normalization context  
   – sc.tl.score_genes assumes log-normalized data. Confirm that mac has already undergone sc.pp.normalize_total + sc.pp.log1p; otherwise add these steps before scoring (or set use_raw=True if raw holds log-norm counts).  

2. Gene-list handling  
   – Warn if too few genes survive intersection:  
     if len(M1_present)<3: raise ValueError("Insufficient M1 genes present.")  
   – ctrl_size=50 is excessive for a 7-gene list and for small macrophage subset. Use ctrl_size=len(gene_list)*2 or leave default (None) to let Scanpy decide.  

3. Reproducibility  
   – Set random seed for score_genes’ control gene sampling: sc.settings.set_figure_params() does not control sampling; use numpy.random.seed(0) before sc.tl.score_genes.  

4. Data integrity / memory  
   – mac.raw = mac.raw is a no-op; drop it.  
   – Storing mac.X into adata.layers['macrophage_subset'] duplicates data and inflates memory. Instead, keep mac as a separate variable or save to adata.uns['macrophage_adata'] if you truly need to attach it.  

5. Visualization  
   – For count bar-plot, sort x-axis numerically (day_counts.sort_index()) – already done, good. Label y-axis with “Number of cells”. Consider adding donor counts as stacked bars for richer sampling overview.  
   – Replace separate histograms with seaborn.kdeplot or violin to convey distribution shapes more clearly; ensure bins are the same for fair comparison.  

6. Code style / clarity  
   – Add descriptive comments or docstrings for each logical block; current comments are terse but acceptable.  
   – Avoid wildcard abbreviations: rename ‘mac’ to ‘macrophages’ for readability.  

7. Safety  
   – Use .copy() after boolean indexing (already done) but also remove unused obs columns if privacy is a concern.  

After addressing the above points, the first step will be robust and ready for downstream correlation analyses.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: During the normal menstrual cycle, endometrial macrophages progressively switch from a pro-inflammatory M1-like program in the early menstrual days to an anti-inflammatory M2-like program in the late secretory phase; therefore single-cell M1 and M2 gene-set scores should show a monotonic decrease (M1) and increase (M2) with increasing numeric cycle day, yielding a positive correlation between an activation index (M2 – M1) and day that is conserved across donors and sequencing platforms.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Subset adata to macrophages (obs['cell_type']=="Macrophages"), run a QC sanity-check (n_cells, n_genes, total_counts distributions) and tabulate cell counts per menstrual day and per platform (obs['dataset']) to confirm sufficient sampling.
2. Confirm that the subset is log-normalised (else apply sc.pp.normalize_total + sc.pp.log1p) and compute per-cell M1 and M2 scores with sc.tl.score_genes, after intersecting curated gene lists with var_names; use a reproducible random seed, adaptive ctrl_size=len(glist)*2, and abort if <3 genes survive.
3. Create an activation_index = M2_score – M1_score and test its association with numeric day: (i) aggregate to donor-level means (one point per donor-day) and run Spearman correlation plus linear regression; (ii) corroborate with a Jonckheere–Terpstra ordered-trend test on early (4–10), mid (11–15), late (16–20) bins to avoid pseudoreplication.
4. Repeat the correlation analyses separately for each sequencing platform ('10x', 'C1'); before testing, require ≥3 donor-day points per platform and visualise platform-specific distributions with violin plots of activation_index across the three day bins.
5. Identify genes whose expression correlates with activation_index across all macrophages (Spearman ρ, Benjamini–Hochberg FDR<0.05, |ρ|>0.3) and display the top 20 positive and negative genes in a dotplot heatmap.
6. Assemble a 2×3 gridspec figure comprising: (A) bar plot of macrophage counts per day (coloured by platform), (B) QC violin of n_genes & total_counts, (C) UMAP coloured by activation_index, (D) scatter of donor-mean activation_index vs day with regression & ρ, (E) platform-stratified violin plots, (F) dotplot of top correlated genes; annotate statistics in relevant panels.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

Based on the results, here's the feedback:

1. **Macrophage Distribution Over Menstrual Cycle:**
    - The distribution shows a peak in macrophage numbers around days 16 and 20, and another increase on day 26. This pattern may reflect biological processes related to the menstrual cycle timing, potentially linked to the phases of tissue remodeling or immune response.
    - Future Steps: It may be useful to cross-reference these macrophage count peaks with known cyclical phases of the endometrium, particularly around the window of implantation (WOI) and menstruation. Further examination of related cytokines and their expression dynamics could offer insights.

2. **M1 and M2 Score Analysis:**
    - The distributions for both M1 and M2 scores show most scores clustered around zero, indicating a lack of strong polarization on average. It might suggest either balanced activity between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory states or non-informative scoring.
    - Future Steps: Investigate specific sample days where M1 or M2 scores deviate from zero. Explore correlations between scores and physiological phases or events, such as inflammation or tissue regeneration periods. Consider refining gene sets for M1/M2 polarization if current results are not aligning with expected biological behavior.

3. **Comparative Analysis with Literature:**
    - Ensure that the analysis distinguishes from the findings and methodologies in the referenced paper, especially with respect to how cell dynamics and functional states are interpreted.
    - Future Steps: Leverage differential expression or trajectory analysis to identify novel markers or signatures that correlate with macrophage activity or their recruitment during specific cycle phases. This may involve integrating additional metadata or histological data points to provide context to observed gene expression changes.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
If macrophages gradually shift from an M1-like to an M2-like state over the menstrual cycle, the per-donor mean activation index (M2_score – M1_score) should correlate positively with the numeric cycle day, and this trend should be visible within each sequencing platform.

Analysis Plan:
['Compute a per-cell activation_index = M2_score – M1_score and aggregate it to donor-day means to avoid pseudo-replication.', 'Quantify the association between activation_index and menstrual day using Spearman correlation and Kendall’s trend test; visualise with a regression-annotated scatter.', 'Repeat the correlation analyses within each sequencing platform and visualise platform-stratified violin plots across early (4–10), mid (11–15), and late (16–20) bins.', 'If a monotonic trend is weak or platform-dependent, perform diffusion-pseudotime (DPT) on macrophages to derive an unsupervised temporal axis and test whether activation_index tracks pseudotime better than calendar day.', 'Identify genes whose expression best correlates with the refined temporal axis (day or pseudotime) and display top positive/negative genes in a dotplot heatmap for biological interpretation.']

Feedback:
Feedback on analysis plan
• Biological novelty: Macrophage polarization dynamics were not explored in the paper, so the hypothesis is novel enough.  
• Statistical approach: Donor-level aggregation avoids pseudo-replication; however, inter-donor heterogeneity (age, parity, batch) and the strong platform effect seen in endometrium data can still confound the global correlation. Consider (i) platform-stratified analyses first, then meta-analyse, or (ii) a partial Spearman (ρ|platform). Mixed-effects regression would be ideal but is impossible with the allowed packages.  
• Clarify DPT root: DPT requires a biologically justified root. State whether the earliest-day macrophages or the highest M1-score cluster will be used.  
• Step order: Do the platform-specific tests before the global test to avoid Simpson’s paradox.  
• Multiple testing: You will perform ≥4 correlation tests; adjust (e.g. Benjamini–Hochberg) or at least report this.  
• Gene-correlation screen (step 5): define a statistic (Spearman or distance-to-median) and threshold for “top genes”; otherwise result may be unstable.  
• Visualisations: add ridge/joy plots or line plot of donor means ± CI across day to complement scatter; dotplot heatmap alone obscures temporal ordering.  
• Reproducibility: explicitly set random_state in DPT (neighbors/umap) so results are deterministic.  
• Completeness: mention QC that M1/M2 gene lists are present in both platforms and whether scores are comparable (e.g. z-score within platform before combining).  

Feedback on first-step Python code
Correctness & statistics
✓ Correct donor-day aggregation, Spearman and Kendall tests.  
✗ Global correlation mixes platforms; platform is added later but you do not control for it in the global test.  
✗ Day bins are hard-coded [3,10,15,21]; observations outside 4–20 will be silently dropped or binned incorrectly. Use bins=[3.5,10.5,15.5,20.5] or infer from data.  
✗ No multiple-testing correction for the per-platform correlations.  

Coding style & efficiency
• Encapsulate blocks in functions (e.g. compute_activation_index, plot_scatter) to reuse later steps.  
• Add a docstring/header explaining that this is step 1 of the macrophage-polarisation analysis.  
• Use mac.obs.loc[:, 'activation_index'] = … to silence potential SettingWithCopyWarning.  
• Guard against re-running: if 'activation_index' already exists, either overwrite with warning or skip.  
• Prefer stats.spearmanr(x, y, nan_policy='omit') in case some donors lack scores.  
• In violinplot, set order=bin_labels to keep correct x-axis order.  
• Use sns.despine() to improve plot aesthetics; keep colour-blind-safe palette such as ‘colorblind’.  
• Seed matplotlib style once (e.g. sns.set_style) rather than relying on defaults.  

Robustness & edge cases
• If a platform has <3 donor-day points you skip its correlation test, but the violin plot will still show a single observation; consider suppressing.  
• If day is stored as string, convert to int before numeric operations.  
• Add an assert that each donor contributes only one day; otherwise donor-day averaging is misleading.  

Compliance with guidelines
✓ Uses only allowed packages.  
✓ Does not write files.  
✗ Re-loading adata in earlier cell duplicates memory; remove that load statement to adhere to “adata already in memory”.  
• The current step partially overlaps with the previously executed code block; make clear that the earlier QC cell (gene-set scoring) precedes this one to avoid duplication.

Actionable summary
1. Remove redundant sc.read_h5ad call.  
2. Z-score M1/M2 scores within platform before computing activation_index or add platform as covariate in correlation.  
3. Parameterise bin edges and add order to violinplot.  
4. Wrap code in functions and include docstrings.  
5. Report adjusted p-values and note platform confounding in narrative.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/endo_data.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results indicate weak correlations and insignificant p-values across both platforms, suggesting that current analyses haven't identified strong relationships in gene expression changes across the menstrual cycle's phases. The combined meta-analysis also fails to reject the null hypothesis, indicating a lack of overall effect. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Refine the Hypothesis**:
   - Reevaluate the specific biological questions or markers being assessed. Consider focusing on more targeted pathways or gene sets known to relate closely to the WOI or other key phase transitions.

2. **Explore Alternative Analyses**:
   - Investigate other statistical methods or machine learning models that might capture more subtle patterns or interactions in the data.
   - Consider using network-based approaches to explore gene interactions or pathways, offering a systems-level view.

3. **Pseudotime Analysis**:
   - Implement pseudotime analysis to identify potential dynamic or transitional states not apparent in static correlation analyses. This could reveal temporal changes missed in cross-sectional analysis.

4. **Cell Type-Specific Analysis**:
   - Conduct separate analyses on different cell types, since aggregating across heterogeneous populations may obscure relevant signals.
   - Look for cell type-specific changes or marker genes that correlate with different menstrual phases.

5. **Subgroup Analyses**:
   - Perform subgroup analyses based on donor characteristics or specific menstrual cycle days to identify any subgroup-specific patterns.

6. **Data Harmonization**:
   - Address potential batch effects or platform-specific biases. Normalization or integration techniques like harmony or Seurat’s integration might help.

7. **Further Biological Context**:
   - Integrate findings with additional biological data, such as protein levels or histological findings, to provide more context or validate the observations.

By refining the analysis and focusing on more specific areas, you might better reveal the underlying biological mechanisms regulating endometrial changes during the menstrual cycle.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Macrophage transcriptional states evolve continuously across the menstrual cycle; a batch-corrected pseudotemporal ordering will correlate more strongly with cycle day than the previously used M1/M2 activation index.

Analysis Plan:
['Integrate macrophage data across platforms with scVI to obtain a batch-corrected latent space and compute diffusion pseudotime (DPT) rooted in earliest-day cells.', 'Quantify association between pseudotime and menstrual day at donor level (Spearman ρ; Jonckheere–Terpstra trend across early/mid/late bins) and visualise UMAP coloured by pseudotime and day.', 'Detect genes whose expression correlates with pseudotime (Spearman, Benjamini–Hochberg FDR<0.05, |ρ|>0.3) and display the top 20 positive/negative genes along the trajectory.', 'Evaluate platform effects by comparing pseudotime distributions between ‘10x’ and ‘C1’ (violin plots, two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) to confirm successful integration.', 'Contrast pseudotime with the previously computed activation_index (Spearman correlation) to test whether they capture related but distinct biological signals.', 'Assemble a multi-panel figure summarising UMAP, pseudotime-day scatter, platform violins, and gene-trajectory heatmap.']

Feedback:
Feedback on analysis plan
• Hypothesis & novelty: Focusing on macrophage‐specific, batch-corrected pseudotime is a clear, biologically motivated extension that was not covered in the paper (which emphasised epithelial and stromal lineages). Using scVI+diffusion maps rather than MI-based principal curves provides methodological novelty. Good fit with guideline #1.  
• Statistical strategy: Spearman ρ and Jonckheere–Terpstra are appropriate, but add a donor-level mixed-effects model or permutation that keeps cells within donor together to guard against residual donor effects (cycle day is partially nested in donor).  
• Root choice: Using “earliest-day cells” irrespective of donor can mix batches; pick root as earliest-day cells from each donor or pick a low-pseudotime Leiden cluster and pass that list to sc.tl.dpt. Document this explicitly.  
• Gene–pseudotime correlation: Filter on mean expression (>0.1 counts) before computing ρ to avoid spurious high |ρ| driven by sparsity.  
• Platform evaluation: Also compare the location of 10x vs C1 in UMAP / in pseudotime ~ platform regression (e.g. linear model) to provide quantitative evidence of batch removal.  
• Figure plan: Six panels may exceed journal size; consider putting platform violin + scatter in one composite panel.  
• Down-stream steps (DE genes, heatmap) should explicitly state that scVI latent Denoised counts (model.get_normalized_expression) will be used for smoother patterns.

Feedback on Step-1 code (scVI + DPT)

Major issues
1. Root cell specification:  
   root_mask = … returns a Boolean Series, but sc.tl.dpt(root_cells=…) expects a list/array of indices. Use  
   root_cells = mac.obs.index[root_mask].tolist()  
2. sc.pl.umap can’t take both color=['pseudotime','day'] and ax=axs[0]. Either loop over two colours (one axis each) or call without ax and then overlay titles. Current call will raise an error.  
3. Jonckheere–Terpstra: scipy.stats.page_trend_test(*phase_scores) requires unpacking. Your call page_trend_test(phase_scores) (and duplicated second call) will fail. Call once and unpack:  
   jt_res = stats.page_trend_test(*phase_scores)  
4. scVI training call: early_stopping=True is not recognised in recent scvi-tools; instead set early_stopping=True in train(…) via keyword or use model.train(max_epochs=100, early_stopping=True, check_val_every_n_epoch=20, plan_kwargs={}). Verify version.  
5. Latent representation should be computed on highly variable genes for speed and stability. Add sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(mac, n_top_genes=3000, flavor='seurat_v3') before setup_anndata and pass layer='counts' if raw counts are not in .X.  
6. The code assumes mac.obs['day'] is numeric; verify dtype and convert earlier to avoid unexpected string sorting.

Minor / style
• Comments say “Step-2” but this is the first step of the new plan; rename for clarity.  
• Use scvi.settings.seed before every stochastic step (neighbors, diffmap) for reproducibility.  
• Explicitly store UMAP coordinates in mac.obsm['X_umap_scVI'] to avoid confusion with previous UMAP.  
• When you aggregate pseudotime, use .median() rather than .mean() (less sensitive to outliers) and print n donors, n days for transparency.  
• For visualisation: set cmap='viridis_r' for day to avoid colour saturation at low days, and include a colour bar.  
• Use plt.close(fig) after showing to avoid memory leaks if this will be run in notebooks repeatedly.

Guideline compliance
• Only allowed packages used: OK.  
• Data not re-loaded: OK.  
• Figures displayed, not saved: OK.  
• New analysis is self-contained and distinct from prior M1/M2 work: Yes.

Actionable summary
– Fix root_cells and Jonckheere–Terpstra calls.  
– Remove ax argument from sc.pl.umap loop or split into separate axes.  
– Update scVI training call to valid kwargs and add highly variable gene selection.  
– Consider donor-aware root definition and mixed-effects correlation for robustness.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/endo_data.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
A smooth transcriptional trajectory within endometrial macrophages reflects their progressive switch from pro-inflammatory (M1-like) to anti-inflammatory (M2-like) states; this trajectory, reconstructed after batch-correcting 10x and C1 data, should correlate with menstrual day and will later enable quantification of M1→M2 activation dynamics.

Analysis Plan:
['Batch-correct macrophage transcriptomes with ComBat, generate a PCA/UMAP embedding, and derive a diffusion-pseudotime ordering rooted in cells from the earliest menstrual day (alternative to the failed scVI approach).', 'Compute per-cell M1 and M2 gene-set scores, z-score within platform, and define an activation_index = M2_z – M1_z; visualise its distribution along pseudotime and menstrual day.', 'Aggregate activation_index to donor-day means and test association with numeric day via Spearman correlation and Jonckheere–Terpstra trend tests; repeat stratified by sequencing platform.', 'Identify genes correlated with activation_index across all macrophages (|ρ|>0.3, BH-FDR<0.05) and visualise the top positive/negative genes in a dotplot heatmap.', 'Construct a multi-panel figure summarising macrophage sampling, QC, UMAP/pseudotime, activation trends, platform-stratified violins, and correlated gene signatures.']

Feedback on analysis plan
• Scientific novelty & focus:  The macrophage-specific M1→M2 trajectory is indeed distinct from the epithelial/stromal trajectories analysed in the paper, so the hypothesis is appropriate.  The five planned steps form a coherent pipeline.  
• Step-1 rationale:  Switching from the earlier scVI attempt to a ComBat-based correction is acceptable, but make sure you later justify that ComBat actually reduces platform effects (UMAP coloured by “dataset”, silhouette score, etc.).  
• Statistical tests:  Jonckheere–Terpstra is not in SciPy.  Either (i) implement it manually, (ii) replace with a monotonic trend test available in SciPy (e.g. Spearman, Kendall, or a linear‐mixed model on ranks), or (iii) clarify that a custom implementation will be supplied.  
• Donor effects:  Aggregating to donor-day means is good, but downstream tests should either weight by donor or include donor as a random effect; otherwise correlated observations inflate significance.  If you keep simple correlations, explicitly state this limitation.  
• Gene correlation cut-off (|ρ|>0.3) may return thousands of genes; consider more stringent |ρ|>0.4 or top-N selection to keep plots interpretable.  
• Figure plan:  Reserve a panel showing UMAP coloured by dataset to document successful batch removal; otherwise reviewers may question ComBat.  
• Reusability:  Step-1 retains only HVGs; later gene-set scoring is run on a freshly created mac object, so there is no conflict, but please state this explicitly to avoid confusion.  

Feedback on Step-1 (ComBat/PCA/UMAP/pseudotime) code
✓ Uses only allowed packages, does not save files, and displays figures.  
✓ Correctly subsets macrophages and roots pseudotime in earliest-day cells per donor.  
Main points to revise / improve  
1. Order of operations around ComBat  
   – Scaling the data BEFORE ComBat changes gene means/variances that ComBat is designed to model and may hinder correction.  
   – Recommended sequence:  
     a) normalise + log1p  
     b) select HVGs  
     c) ComBat on log space (mac.X)  
     d) scale (max_value=10)  
     e) PCA → neighbours → UMAP.  
   – Alternatively, keep the current scaling but call sc.pp.combat on PCs (pass inplace=False and supply covariate) rather than on expression; clearly document the choice.  
2. Re-scaling after ComBat  
   If ComBat is kept on expression, the post-ComBat PCA should be preceded by a fresh sc.pp.scale(mac) because gene means/variances have changed.  
3. HVG selection bias  
   Highly variable genes are chosen before correction.  This is fine if flavour=‘seurat_v3’ with batch_key, but clarify this in comments so the reader knows batch bias was mitigated.  
4. Sparse matrix handling  
   sc.pp.combat converts to dense.  For the small macrophage subset this is fine, but add a note that this may inflate memory if the subset grows.  
5. Root cell selection  
   The current root_cells list may contain hundreds of cells (all donors’ earliest‐day cells).  For DPT, fewer high-confidence roots improve stability.  Consider:  
     root_cells = mac.obs.groupby('donor')['day'].idxmin().tolist()  
   (takes exactly one cell per donor).  At least add an explanatory comment.  
6. Random seeds  
   Add np.random.seed(0) and sc.settings.set_figure_params(dpi=100) for full reproducibility, and pass random_state to UMAP/diffmap.  
7. Metadata provenance  
   Store key outputs for later steps:  
     mac.obs['dataset_corrected_pseudotime'] = mac.obs['pseudotime']  
     mac.obsm['X_pca_combat'] = mac.obsm['X_pca']  
8. QC metrics  
   Consider adding mitochondrial-percent filter or at least recording it; macrophages often show high mitochondrial content.  
9. Small stylistic items  
   –  Use inplace=False returns for sc.pp.combat to keep original layer intact if you later need raw counts.  
   –  Remove redundant .copy() after mac.var['highly_variable'] selection; this already returns a view.  
   –  Close figures with plt.close() right after showing (avoid memory leaks in loops).  

If these adjustments are implemented, Step-1 will more robustly produce a platform-corrected trajectory suitable for the downstream activation-index analyses.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/endo_data.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Endometrial macrophages progressively shift from a pro-inflammatory (M1) to an anti-inflammatory (M2) program over the menstrual cycle; therefore single-cell M1 scores should decline, M2 scores should rise, and an activation index (M2–M1) should positively correlate with cycle day across donors and sequencing technologies.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset adata to macrophages, run a basic QC check (cell and gene counts, per-day sampling) and log-normalise the data if not already normalised (sc.pp.normalize_total + sc.pp.log1p).', 'Compute per-cell M1 and M2 gene-set scores with sc.tl.score_genes after intersecting curated gene lists with var_names; store scores in obs and visualise their distributions.', 'Create an activation_index = M2_score – M1_score (z-scored within platform) and test its association with numeric cycle day by donor-day aggregation using Spearman correlation and a Jonckheere–Terpstra trend test across early/mid/late bins.', "Repeat correlation analyses separately for each sequencing platform ('10x', 'C1') and display platform-stratified violin plots of activation_index across cycle bins.", 'Identify genes whose expression correlates with activation_index across all macrophages (Spearman |ρ|>0.3, BH-FDR<0.05) and show the top 20 positive/negative genes in a dotplot heat-map.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# --------------------------------------------------------
# Step-2 | Gene-set scoring for macrophage M1/M2 programs
# --------------------------------------------------------

# 1) Ensure macrophage subset exists
if 'mac' not in locals():
    mac = adata[adata.obs['cell_type'] == 'Macrophages'].copy()

# 2) Ensure data are log-normalised; create .raw for safety
if mac.raw is None:
    sc.pp.normalize_total(mac, target_sum=1e4)
    sc.pp.log1p(mac)
    mac.raw = mac

# 3) Define curated gene lists (literature-based)
M1_genes = ['IL1B', 'TNF', 'CXCL10', 'NOS2', 'CXCL9', 'IL6', 'CD80']
M2_genes = ['MRC1', 'CD163', 'IL10', 'ARG1', 'MSR1', 'PPARG', 'CCL22']

# 4) Harmonise gene symbols (case-insensitive) and intersect with dataset
upper2orig = {g.upper(): g for g in mac.var_names}
M1_present = [upper2orig[g] for g in map(str.upper, M1_genes) if g in upper2orig]
M2_present = [upper2orig[g] for g in map(str.upper, M2_genes) if g in upper2orig]

if len(M1_present) < 3 or len(M2_present) < 3:
    raise ValueError(f"Insufficient overlap with dataset genes: {len(M1_present)} M1 / {len(M2_present)} M2 found.")

# 5) Compute scores (adaptive ctrl_size = 2×len(gene_list), reproducible seed)
sc.tl.score_genes(mac, gene_list=M1_present, score_name='M1_score', ctrl_size=len(M1_present)*2, random_state=0)
sc.tl.score_genes(mac, gene_list=M2_present, score_name='M2_score', ctrl_size=len(M2_present)*2, random_state=0)

# 6) Quick visual QC of score distributions by platform
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(9, 3))
sc.pl.violin(mac, ['M1_score'], groupby='dataset', ax=axes[0], stripplot=False, show=False)
axes[0].set_title('M1 score')

Feedback:
Feedback on Analysis Plan
• Novelty/biological relevance: Focusing on temporal M1→M2 shift in endometrial macrophages is distinct from the paper’s epithelial/stromal emphasis – good.  
• Step-3 statistic: SciPy ≤1.10 lacks Jonckheere–Terpstra; confirm cluster version or replace with a simple ordered-group Kruskal-Wallis plus post-hoc trend (or implement JT manually).  
• Aggregation level: Donor-day averaging is sensible, but consider weighting by #cells to avoid small-sample noise.  
• Z-scoring “within platform” is correct; explicitly verify equal variance assumption and store the means/SDs used to keep later steps reproducible.  
• Gene-correlation screen (Step-5): |ρ|>0.3 with BH on ~20 k genes can yield many hits; add min expression filter (e.g. ≥5 % cells) to control sparsity bias and speed.  
• Dotplot heat-map: decide grouping (e.g. quartiles of activation_index or cycle bins) up-front – sc.pl.dotplot requires categorical x-axis.  
• Overall flow: integrate QC/normalisation once at the start; later steps (scVI, scoring) should work on copies to avoid mixing raw/log-counts.

Feedback on First-Step Code (gene-set scoring block)
1. Raw handling  
   • mac.raw = mac after normalisation overwrites raw with log1p data; instead do  
     mac.raw = mac.copy()  # BEFORE normalisation  
     or skip assigning raw at all.  
2. Normalisation guard  
   • Checking `mac.raw is None` is unreliable (raw may exist but be counts); better test for a “log1p_performed” flag or inspect max value.  
3. scVI interaction  
   • Earlier cells trained scVI on the same `mac`; your Step-2 now log-normalises that object in-place, corrupting counts required for any further scVI DE.  
     ‑> Work on a fresh copy (e.g. mac_norm = mac.copy()) for scoring.  
4. Gene-name harmonisation  
   • Nice case-insensitive mapping, but fails if symbols appear twice (e.g. pseudogenes). Use mac.var_names.unique() to be safe or drop duplicates first.  
5. ctrl_size  
   • Setting ctrl_size = 2×len(gene_list) can fall below Scanpy’s default 50 for small lists; ensure min 25–50 or leave as default.  
6. Plotting  
   • sc.pl.violin modifies figure dpi settings; supply `show=False` but remember to close the figure (`plt.close(fig)`) to avoid memory leaks.  
7. Robustness  
   • If ‘dataset’ column is missing or renamed, violin will error; wrap with assert 'dataset' in mac.obs.  
8. Style / reproducibility  
   • Set a global random seed (`np.random.seed(0)`) so future NumPy/SciPy operations are reproducible too.  
9. Docstrings / comments  
   • Change header comment to “Step-2 of plan” only if Step-1 already executed; otherwise rename to avoid confusion.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/endo_data.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Endometrial macrophages progressively transition from an M1-like to an M2-like program across the menstrual cycle; consequently a per-cell activation index (M2_score − M1_score, platform-z-normalised) should increase with cycle day, yielding positive donor-level correlations that are consistent across sequencing platforms.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset adata to macrophages, confirm/perform total-count normalisation + log1p, run QC violins (n_genes, total_counts) and tabulate cell numbers per day & platform; compute per-cell M1 and M2 scores with sc.tl.score_genes after intersecting curated lists with var_names.', 'Derive activation_index = M2_z – M1_z (z-score within each platform); aggregate to donor-day means and test association with numeric day using Spearman correlation and Kendall’s τ; visualise with (i) scatter+regression coloured by platform and (ii) violin plots across three ordered day bins; report statistics and Benjamini-Hochberg–adjusted p-values per platform and combined meta-p (Fisher).', 'Repeat correlation analyses separately within each platform (10x, C1) requiring ≥3 donor-day points; compare slopes via interaction term in an ordinary least squares model on the aggregated data to check platform consistency.', 'Test whether pseudotime (from step-1 alternative diffusion-map approach) correlates more strongly with activation_index than numeric day, indicating that polarisation follows a continuous trajectory not strictly linear in calendar time.', 'Identify genes whose expression (within macrophages) correlates with activation_index (|ρ|>0.3, FDR<0.05) and visualise top 20 positive/negative genes in a dotplot heatmap to nominate additional markers of polarisation.', 'Assemble a multi-panel figure summarising QC, sampling, activation trend and correlated genes for inclusion in the manuscript.']

Feedback:
Analysis plan  
• Hypothesis is clear, biologically motivated and not covered in the original paper – good.  
• Step order is logical; QC → scoring → aggregate → stats → visualisation → downstream gene discovery.  
• However, association tests that ignore donor ID as a random effect risk inflating significance if any donor contributes >1 day. Replace simple Spearman/Kendall with a mixed-effects model (random intercept = donor, fixed slope = day) or, if each donor is indeed sampled once, state this assumption explicitly.  
• “Z-score within each platform” is appropriate for cross-platform comparability, but note that platform size differences will still affect the combined meta-p. Consider inverse-variance weighting or a mixed model with platform as fixed effect instead of Fisher’s method.  
• Define minimal inclusion criteria (e.g. ≥30 macrophage cells per donor-day) before aggregation to avoid unstable donor means.  
• Pseudotime comparison (step-4) is nice and novel, but be explicit that you will partial-out day (partial Spearman) to quantify whether pseudotime explains residual variance.  
• Gene–activation correlation cut-offs (|ρ|>0.3, FDR<0.05) should be justified or chosen data-driven. Mention two-tailed test.  
• Step-6 figure list is good; ensure figure labels make clear that activation_index is platform-z scored.

Code (first-step “Activation-index trend”)  
✓ Correctly subsets macrophages, scores genes, platform-z-scores, aggregates donor-day, runs Spearman/Kendall and plots.

Points to improve / bugs  
1. Normalisation. mac is only library-normalised/log1p if mac had to be rebuilt; if Step-1 has already run (where counts are raw), score_genes will work on raw counts. Always call sc.pp.normalize_total + sc.pp.log1p before scoring to guarantee comparable scale.  
2. Gene symbols are case-sensitive; check both upper- and lower-case (e.g. 'Il10'). Include warning if <4 genes retained for a signature.  
3. Z-score: std could be zero; you guard against divide-by-zero but leave constant group variance =0 scored as 0; better to drop platform with zero variance.  
4. Benjamini–Hochberg: cap at 1.0 (p_adj = np.minimum(1, …)).  
5. Fisher meta-p uses Spearman p only; state this in printout.  
6. Violin bins (3.5–20.5) omit day ≤3 and ≥21; add sentinel bins or assert max day ≤20.  
7. Possible SettingWithCopy warning on agg['phase'] assignment. Use .assign or pd.cut on a copy.  
8. Colour palette mapping can break if palette dict key missing (e.g. regplot when palette keyed by dataset); safer to fetch colour by dict.get(plat).  
9. Use seaborn.regplot scatter_kws={'s':0} or line_kws={'linewidth':1.5} to avoid over-plotting.  
10. Randomness: set np.random.seed before score_genes to make ctrl gene selection reproducible.  
11. Place heavy computations (scoring) in functions so later steps can reuse without rerunning.  
12. Docstrings / comments: clarify that dataset == platform (10x vs C1) and that donor-day uniqueness is assumed.

Stylistic / guideline alignment  
• Uses only allowed libraries.  
• Does not save figures to disk; displays them.  
• Code is mostly PEP-8 compliant; wrap long lines (e.g. transform lambda) and avoid multi-statement lines with ‘;’.  
• Variable names consistent with plan.

Additions suggested  
– Print table of gene counts per macrophage subset for transparency.  
– Save mac with scores in adata.obsm/obs for downstream steps to avoid recomputing.  
– After scoring, plot correlations of M1 and M2 scores to check they are not collinear.

With these refinements, the code will be robust, reproducible and fully aligned with the analysis plan.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/endo_data.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.



You are given the following summary of the anndata object:

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Endometrial macrophages progressively shift from a pro-inflammatory (M1) to an anti-inflammatory (M2) program over the menstrual cycle, such that an activation index (M2 – M1) increases with numeric cycle day across donors and sequencing platforms.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset adata to macrophages, perform library-size normalisation (10,000 CPM) and log1p transform if not already done; keep only genes expressed in ≥3% of macrophages to reduce noise.', 'Compute per-cell M1 and M2 gene-set scores (curated lists) with sc.tl.score_genes, using ctrl_size = len(gset)*2 and a fixed random_seed; abort if fewer than three genes from either list are present after intersection.', 'Create a z-transformed activation_index = M2_z – M1_z (z-scored within each sequencing platform), aggregate to donor-day means, and test association with numeric day using both Spearman correlation and ordinary least-squares regression; report coefficients and P-values.', 'Visualise results: (i) UMAP of macrophages coloured by activation_index, (ii) scatter of donor-mean activation_index vs day with regression line, (iii) violin plots of activation_index across three day bins (Early 4–10, Mid 11–15, Late 16–20) stratified by platform.', "Repeat the correlation analysis separately for each platform ('10x', 'C1'); combine P-values with Fisher’s method to obtain an overall meta-analytic significance.", 'Identify genes whose expression correlates with activation_index (Spearman |ρ|>0.3, BH-FDR<0.05) across all macrophages; visualise the top 15 positive and 15 negative genes in a dotplot.']

Feedback on analysis plan
• Biological novelty: Focusing on a quantitative M1→M2 shift across the menstrual cycle is new relative to the paper, which did not investigate immune-polarisation. Good choice.  
• Logical flow: steps are coherent, but Step 1 (library normalisation & gene filtering) should be performed once and reused by later steps; explicitly state whether counts in adata are raw or already normalised to avoid accidental double normalisation.  
• Statistics: Plan promises both Spearman and OLS (with coefficients & P-values); current code implements only Spearman. Add OLS with heteroskedasticity-robust SEs or report R².  
• Multiple testing: The gene–activation correlation step (|ρ|>0.3,BH-FDR<0.05) needs a clear FDR procedure (e.g. Benjamini–Hochberg) and should state the background gene universe (filtered genes).  
• Confounders: Consider donor as a random effect or at minimum cluster-robust SEs; platform-specific z-scaling helps, but OLS/Spearman still treat observations as independent.  
• Day bins: define bin edges inclusive/exclusive beforehand; include days 21–28 if present to future-proof.  
• Reproducibility: Fix random seeds for all stochastic functions (filter_genes not stochastic, but score_genes and seaborn palette are).  
• Visualization: UMAP colouring by activation_index is listed but missing from code; dotplot of top correlated genes needs clear grouping (e.g. bins or continuous colour scale).  
• Meta-analysis: Fisher’s method is fine; mention that it assumes independence across platforms.  
• Optional: add leave-one-donor-out sensitivity or partial correlation controlling for pseudotime (already computed in earlier scVI step) to strengthen causality.

Feedback on first-step Python code
General
✔ Uses only allowed packages, runs in-memory adata, readable.  
✗ Duplicated “Step-1 | scVI & pseudotime” cells appear four times—keep one version to avoid wasted compute and accidental state inconsistencies.  
✗ The macrophage polarisation code partly overlaps with earlier cells; consolidate to avoid re-computing scores each time the notebook is rerun.

Specific issues / suggestions
1. Normalisation & filtering  
   – sc.pp.filter_genes should be called on raw counts before log1p; current order (normalise→log1p→filter) may under-estimate expression and drops raw counts.  
   – Instead of checking a custom uns flag, rely on `adata.raw is not None` or store normalised data in a layer to keep raw counts intact for downstream DE tests.  

2. score_genes  
   – `random_state` parameter is not available in older Scanpy; robust alternative is `sc.tl.score_genes(..., use_raw=False, seed=0)`.  
   – Use the same `ctrl_size` for M1 and M2 (currently correct) but also pass `ctrl_size=None` if ≤50 genes to avoid drawing with replacement.  

3. Z-scoring  
   – Grouping by ‘dataset’ is appropriate for platform effects, but variance could be zero for a group (handled). Consider also centering by donor-within-platform to remove donor-specific offsets.  

4. Aggregation & statistics  
   – OLS regression missing; implement with `stats.linregress` or `statsmodels` (if sticking to allowed packages, numpy polyfit) and print slope ± SE.  
   – Spearman across very small n (≤10 donor-means) gives low power; confidence intervals or permutation P-value would be more informative.  

5. Multiple testing / BH  
   – Benjamini–Hochberg helper is implemented but unused for gene-level correlations (future step). Keep but document.  

6. Visualisation  
   – UMAP coloured by activation_index not plotted (analysis plan item).  
   – Violin: `split=True` requires exactly two hue levels; code breaks if only one platform present after filtering. Add guard.  
   – Scatter: regression line plotted twice (black global + coloured platform-specific loops). Either drop global or platform regressions for clarity.  

7. Robustness checks  
   – Assert ≥3 genes present complies with plan, but give informative message listing missing genes.  
   – Add warning if any macrophage day is NaN after coercion; silently dropping could bias results.

8. Style / reproducibility  
   – Seed for numpy/random not fixed.  
   – Avoid hard-coding magic numbers (bins=[3.5,10.5,15.5,20.5]); define at top as constants.

Minor
• Function names in helper section are clear; docstrings would help.  
• Remove unused imports (numpy in first block, scvi in later block when not used).  
• `plt.close(fig)` unnecessary immediately after `show()` unless running in non-interactive backend, but fine.

Overall, the code is a solid starting point and broadly implements Step 1, but needs deduplication, ordering fixes (filter before log), completion of promised analyses (OLS, UMAP, gene-correlation), and tighter handling of edge cases to fully satisfy the analysis plan and guidelines.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/endo_data.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/endo_data.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps. 

You are given the following summary of the anndata object:
Below is a description of the columns in adata.obs:

Here are the previous analyses attempted:
During the normal menstrual cycle, endometrial macrophages progressively switch from a pro-inflammatory M1-like program in the early menstrual days to an anti-inflammatory M2-like program in the late secretory phase; therefore single-cell M1 and M2 gene-set scores should show a monotonic decrease (M1) and increase (M2) with increasing numeric cycle day, yielding a positive correlation between an activation index (M2 – M1) and day that is conserved across donors and sequencing platforms.


Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
This study focuses on the human endometrium—a dynamic tissue that undergoes cyclical remodeling, shedding, and regeneration during the menstrual cycle. These dramatic transformations are central to reproductive physiology, as they underlie fertility and the establishment of a receptive state for embryo implantation known as the window of implantation (WOI). The biological background of the study is rooted in understanding how different cell types within the endometrium change their gene expression profiles over the cycle, how these changes regulate tissue homeostasis, and how failures or deviations in these processes might be linked to fertility issues and endometrial diseases.

Biological background  
Relevant biological questions include deciphering the molecular signatures that define each phase of the menstrual cycle, particularly the abrupt transcriptional activation that marks the opening of the WOI. The investigation also centers on the mechanisms behind cellular differentiation, decidualization of stromal fibroblasts, and the interplay among various cell types—including ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells, stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells, and smooth muscle cells. This enhanced resolution of cellular heterogeneity paves the way for better understanding of normal reproductive physiology and provides a baseline reference for studying endometrial pathologies.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors began their investigation by applying dimensional reduction techniques (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, or t-SNE, and uniform manifold approximation, UMAP) on single-cell RNA sequencing data generated using the Fluidigm C1 platform and validated with the 10x Chromium system. They analyzed 2,148 cells from 19 healthy donors, identifying clear segregation into distinct groups. Differential expression analysis and density-based clustering revealed six major cell types—stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, unciliated epithelium, and a previously uncharacterized ciliated epithelium. In the 10x dataset of over 71,000 cells, an additional smooth muscle cell type was uncovered. The identification and characterization of these cell types, using canonical markers and newly discovered discriminatory genes (e.g., those marking ciliated epithelium), provide a comprehensive cellular atlas of the endometrium.

Paper’s computational analyses  
Next, the study employed a mutual information (MI)–based approach to build a pseudotime trajectory that connected cellular transcriptomic states across the menstrual cycle within the major endometrial cell types. By selecting “time-associated” genes, the researchers generated principal curves in t-SNE space to order cells along a continuous trajectory. This analysis revealed four distinct phases for both unciliated epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts. A striking finding was that unciliated epithelia displayed an abrupt, discontinuous transition in gene expression—marked by a rapid activation of a specific gene module that includes PAEP, GPX3, and CXCL14—corresponding to the opening of the WOI. In contrast, stromal fibroblasts showed a more gradual transition with modular upregulation of decidualization markers, underscoring different dynamics in epithelial versus stromal compartment transitions.

Paper’s computational analyses  
Further detailed analyses focused on unraveling finer cellular heterogeneity and regulatory mechanisms. The unciliated epithelium was deconvoluted into glandular and luminal subtypes based on differential expression of genes such as WNT7A, LGR5, and FOXA2; these markers correspond to previously documented differences in anatomical function and remodeling during the cycle. Additionally, the study characterized global transcription factor dynamics and secreted protein profiles by clustering dynamically expressed genes in both cell types. The team applied gene ontology enrichment to relate these expression patterns to processes like differentiation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and morphogenesis. Parallel cell cycle analyses using canonical G1/S and G2/M gene sets helped identify proliferative versus secretory phases, confirming that the transition from a high-cycling state to a quiescent, receptive state occurs between phases in both epithelia and stromal fibroblasts, thereby linking transcriptomic signatures with histological observations.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises multi-platform single-cell transcriptomic profiles derived from human endometrial biopsies collected from healthy ovum donors during a natural menstrual cycle. Specifically, 19 donors contributed samples to the Fluidigm C1 dataset (2,148 cells), while an independent validation set of ten donors was profiled using the 10x Chromium system (over 71,000 cells). Alongside cell-type–specific gene expression counts, the dataset includes metadata such as day of menstrual cycle, phase assignments based on both transcriptomic and histological criteria, and spatial data from RNAscope and immunofluorescence imaging. This rich combinatorial dataset connects molecular signatures to key reproductive events like the WOI and decidualization, serving as an essential resource for understanding normal endometrial physiology and providing a baseline for future studies on endometrial diseases and fertility treatments.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: Stromal fibroblasts undergo a metabolic reprogramming during the menstrual cycle, shifting from oxidative phosphorylation toward glycolysis; therefore, a glycolysis-minus-OXPHOS score (‘metabolic_shift’) will show a significant positive correlation with increasing cycle day specifically within stromal fibroblasts and not in other cell types.

Analysis Plan:
1. Compile hallmark glycolysis and oxidative-phosphorylation (OXPHOS) gene sets and compute per-cell pathway scores in the whole dataset, then derive a metabolic_shift score (glycolysis – OXPHOS).
2. Restrict to stromal fibroblasts, visualize metabolic_shift versus numeric cycle day with a scatter/violin plot stratified by sequencing platform; compute Spearman correlation and print statistics.
3. Quantify donor-specific effects by calculating per-donor correlations between metabolic_shift and day; summarize slopes in a boxplot and test whether the median slope differs from zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank).
4. Test cell-type specificity by comparing metabolic_shift distributions across all major cell types using violin plots and Kruskal–Wallis followed by pair-wise Wilcoxon tests (Benjamini–Hochberg correction).
5. Perform differential-expression analysis between early (day ≤10) and late (day ≥16) stromal fibroblasts to identify individual metabolic genes driving the shift; visualize top up- and down-regulated genes with a dot plot.

Feedback:
Feedback on analysis plan
• Novelty: The focus on a glycolysis-minus-OXPHOS shift in stromal fibroblasts is distinct from both the paper (which did not study metabolism explicitly) and the prior macrophage analysis. Good.

• Biological logic: Hypothesis is well-founded (decidualization is known to alter energy metabolism), but consider specifying whether you expect the shift to be linear or phase-specific; cycle day vs. secretory phase could behave non-linearly.

• Confounders: Platform (C1 vs 10x), donor, and cell-cycle state all influence metabolic genes. Explicitly include (or at least test) these as covariates—e.g. partial Spearman controlling for platform, or regress out cell-cycle scores before correlation.

• Gene sets: Hallmark H ‑ GSEA “GLYCOLYSIS” (200 genes) and “OXIDATIVE_PHOSPHORYLATION” (~200 genes) are much larger than the 20-gene mini-lists in the code; restricting to a short subset may reduce power and introduce bias. Consider using the full MSigDB lists filtered to the dataset.

• Step order: Be sure normalization/log-transform has been performed (sc.pp.normalize_total + sc.pp.log1p) before scoring. If adata is already processed, document that; otherwise add.

• Statistics: For donor-wise slopes (step 3) you are mixing correlation and slope terminology. Decide on a single metric—either Spearman ρ per donor or linear-fit slope; state clearly which one will feed the Wilcoxon test.

• Multiple testing: Step 4 (pairwise Wilcoxon across cell types) should correct p-values for both number of pairs and the earlier Kruskal-Wallis (e.g. Benjamini–Hochberg).

• Visualization: Scatter + smoothed trend line (e.g. seaborn.regplot with lowess) may convey the relationship better than violin alone. When mixing platform stratification, facet-grid plots avoid over-plotting.

• DE step: Define covariates (donor/platform) for DE. Since Scanpy’s rank_genes_groups has no mixed model, at minimum stratify by donor or down-sample to balanced donors to reduce confounding.

• Runtime: Whole-dataset scoring is cheap, but DE on tens of thousands of cells can be slow; consider limiting to stromal fibroblasts first.

Feedback on step-1 code
• Package compliance: Only scanpy/numpy/pandas are used—compliant.

• Gene symbol case: You assume adata.var_names are uppercase; if they are mixed-case, many genes will be missed. Convert var_names to .str.upper() for matching or map gene symbols via adata.var['gene_symbols'] when available.

• Gene-set completeness: Lists are truncated; replace with full hallmark gene lists or document rationale. At minimum, warn if <50 % of genes are found.

• Data normalization: sc.tl.score_genes expects log-scaled data. Add a check:
    if 'log1p' not in adata.uns: 
        sc.pp.normalize_total(adata) ; sc.pp.log1p(adata)
or assert that preprocessing has already been done.

• Control gene set size: Provide ctrl_size to sc.tl.score_genes so glycolysis and OXPHOS scores are comparable (default 50, but OXPHOS list length might be >50). Example:
    sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list=gly_genes_present, score_name='glycolysis_score', ctrl_size=len(gly_genes_present))

• Reproducibility: Set random_state in score_genes to make scores deterministic across runs.

• Duplicates: You already call var_names_make_unique(); also drop duplicate symbols in the gene lists with list(dict.fromkeys(...)).

• Output: Good that you print how many genes were found. Also print a warning if <10 genes are present for either list.

• Memory safety: score_genes modifies adata.obs in place; that’s intended, but mention it in comments.

Minor/style
• Add module-level docstring summarizing purpose, inputs, outputs.

• Stick to PEP-8 line length (≤ 79 chars).

• Remove unused imports (numpy) if not needed in this step.

Overall, the code is a solid starting point but needs gene-set completeness, preprocessing checks, and stronger handling of confounders to make the resulting ‘metabolic_shift’ score reliable for downstream statistical tests.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/endo_data.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: During progression through the menstrual cycle, stromal fibroblasts progressively shift their energy metabolism away from oxidative phosphorylation toward glycolysis.  Consequently, a per-cell ‘metabolic_shift’ score (Hallmark_Glycolysis score minus Hallmark_OXPHOS score) will increase with cycle day in stromal fibroblasts, but not in other uterine cell types, even after accounting for sequencing platform, donor, and cell-cycle state.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Confirm that adata is log-normalised; if not, perform total count normalisation and log1p.  Compute cell-cycle S and G2M scores, then regress out S_score, G2M_score, total_counts, and percent_mito to minimise confounding.
2. Import the complete MSigDB Hallmark gene sets for Glycolysis and Oxidative-Phosphorylation (or retrieve them from adata.uns if already stored).  Match in upper-case against adata.var_names, report coverage, and compute pathway scores with sc.tl.score_genes (ctrl_size = list length, random_state fixed).  Derive metabolic_shift = Glycolysis – OXPHOS and store in adata.obs.
3. Within stromal fibroblasts: (a) plot metabolic_shift versus cycle day with seaborn.regplot (lowess) faceted by sequencing platform; (b) compute Spearman ρ between metabolic_shift and day; (c) compute partial Spearman by correlating residuals from linear models that remove platform effects.
4. Quantify donor effects: for every donor having ≥ 20 stromal fibroblasts, fit a simple linear model metabolic_shift ~ day and store the slope.  Display slopes in a boxplot and test whether the median slope differs from zero with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (two-sided).
5. Assess cell-type specificity: compare metabolic_shift distributions across all major cell types with a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected pair-wise Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.  Visualise violin plots ordered by median score.
6. Differential expression in stromal fibroblasts: label cells as ‘early’ (day ≤ 10) or ‘late’ (day ≥ 16), down-sample to equal donor representation, and run rank_genes_groups (method='wilcoxon').  Highlight top up- and down-regulated metabolic genes in a dot plot.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The analysis you've conducted measures glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) gene set scores in the context of single-cell transcriptome data from the human endometrium. You've successfully computed scores for both pathways, finding all glycolysis genes and a majority of the OXPHOS genes. This step is promising as it allows for quantification of metabolic activity, which may provide insights into cellular states throughout the menstrual cycle.

Here are some feedback points to consider for future steps and how they may relate to the hypothesis:

1. **Differential Metabolic Signatures Across the Cycle:** 
   - Since the metabolic shifts might correlate with different phases of the menstrual cycle, particularly with the transcriptomic transitions marked by the window of implantation (WOI), examining these scores across cycle days could reveal associations with phase-specific metabolic states.
   - Further analysis could involve correlating these scores with key reproductive events, such as the transition from proliferative to secretory phases.

2. **Integration with Pseudotime Analysis:**
   - The pseudotime trajectory established in the study indicates shifts in transcriptomic states. Incorporating glycolysis and OXPHOS scores along these trajectories might reveal dynamic metabolic changes associated with different cell types and their progression through the cycle.

3. **Subtype-Specific Metabolic Profiles:**
   - Consider investigating whether distinct cell types or subtypes identified in the study (e.g., glandular vs. luminal epithelium) exhibit different glycolysis and OXPHOS profiles. This can provide finer granularity with respect to cellular metabolism during each reproductive phase.

4. **Comparison with Existing Literature:**
   - Cross-reference the metabolic shifts observed with known markers of the phases within the menstrual cycle. This could include transcriptional activation signals around the WOI, which may be supported by a surge in metabolic activity reflecting increased glucose uptake or energy demand.

5. **Potential Limitation Adjustments:**
   - The discrepancy in the number of genes found for glycolysis and OXPHOS could reflect differences in pathway annotation, sequencing depth, or coverage. It would be beneficial to validate these findings with additional datasets, especially focusing on control gene selection and pathway completeness.

6. **Time-Point Specific Analysis:**
   - Conduct time-specific analysis for these metabolic scores to understand their fluctuations within and between distinct phases of the menstrual cycle, which might align with histological or transcriptomic phase assignments in the dataset.

Moving forward, the integration of metabolic scores with transcriptomic and phase-specific data will significantly enhance understanding of metabolic dynamics in the endometrium, particularly linking them to the key biological questions raised in the study. This may pave the way to identify metabolic states that are critical for normal reproductive physiology and might identify aberrations related to fertility and endometrial diseases.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
In stromal fibroblasts, the per-cell ‘metabolic_shift’ score (Hallmark_Glycolysis – Hallmark_OXPHOS) rises with increasing menstrual-cycle day even after adjusting for sequencing platform, suggesting a progressive shift toward glycolysis that is specific to this lineage.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset stromal fibroblasts and test the association between metabolic_shift and numeric cycle day: (a) visualise with scatter/LOWESS plots stratified by sequencing platform, (b) compute global Spearman ρ and per-platform ρ, and (c) estimate a partial Spearman correlation that regresses out platform effects.', 'Quantify donor-specific trends: for donors with ≥20 stromal fibroblasts, fit linear models (metabolic_shift ~ day), collect slopes, visualise their distribution, and test whether the median slope differs from zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank).', 'Integrate trajectory information: build a diffusion-pseudotime axis within stromal fibroblasts (root = earliest day cells) and correlate metabolic_shift with pseudotime to see whether the metabolic programme follows the inferred developmental progression.', 'Assess cell-type specificity by comparing metabolic_shift distributions across all major cell types using Kruskal–Wallis and BH-corrected pair-wise Wilcoxon tests; visualise with ordered violins.', 'Perform differential expression between early (day ≤10) and late (day ≥16) stromal fibroblasts, highlighting metabolism-related genes, and visualise with a dot plot.']

Feedback:
Feedback on Analysis Plan
• Novelty: examining a glycolysis-vs-OXPHOS score across the menstrual cycle in stromal fibroblasts is indeed distinct from the paper’s decidualization-centric analyses and from the prior M1/M2 macrophage attempt. Good choice.
• Step ordering is logical: simple association → donor-level slopes → trajectory → specificity → DE. Each step can stand alone and builds biological narrative.
• Potential gaps
  – Platform is handled, but donor is not adjusted until step 2. Because day and donor are partially confounded (one biopsy per donor), donor effects could inflate associations already in step 1. Consider adding a donor-stratified Spearman or a mixed-effects model (random donor intercept) instead of, or in addition to, the current partial correlation.
  – Cycle-day range is discrete and short (4-20); LOWESS may over-smooth with small n per day. Check span or use `scatterplot + lineplot` with `ci=None` to avoid misleading curves.
  – DPT root: “earliest day cells” must be defined explicitly; e.g. choose cell(s) with minimal day or the earliest-day Leiden cluster. Document this to ensure reproducibility.
  – Multiple hypothesis correction: steps 1(b) and 1(c) each run several correlations; adjust for the 3 tests (global + 2 platforms) or report them as descriptive.
• Statistical tests: Wilcoxon signed-rank in step 2 is fine, but count how many donors meet the ≥20-cell criterion and report that number; power will otherwise be unclear.
• Step 4 requires large samples across all cell types; if some cell types are rare (e.g. smooth muscle) warn about robustness or pool similar ones.

Feedback on First-Step Python Code
Functionality / correctness
✓ Correctly subsets stromal fibroblasts and coerces ‘day’ to int when categorical.
✓ Uses LOWESS scatter, global / per-platform Spearman, and a residual-based partial Spearman.

Issues & improvements
1. Partial Spearman implementation: you regress raw values on platform but then apply Spearman to the residuals. Because Spearman works on ranks, residualising raw values distorts monotonic but non-linear relationships. Better: convert each variable to ranks first, then regress ranks on platform, or use the `pingouin.partial_corr` method (not allowed here) re-implemented with the covariance of rank-transformed variables.
2. `np.linalg.lstsq` without intercept forces residuals through origin. Add an intercept column of ones or use `statsmodels` (not allowed) → quickest fix: prepend a constant column (`X = sm.add_constant(...)`) but you can instead center variables per platform or use `pd.get_dummies(..., drop_first=False)` and include `np.ones`.
3. If only two platforms exist, dropping the first dummy leaves a single column that encodes C1 vs 10x, OK, but remember the intercept issue above.
4. Missing handling of tied ranks in Spearman; scipy already accounts, but mention in comments that many identical day values exist.
5. Potential warning: if one platform lacks variation in day or score, `spearmanr` returns nan; check `if len(df['day'].unique())>1`.
6. Visual: `sns.lmplot(..., lowess=True)` implicitly fits linear regression too; to avoid confusion set `fit_reg=False` or switch to `sns.scatterplot` + `sns.lineplot` with `lowess`. Also increase marker size for clarity on >70 K cells.
7. Plot them in `FacetGrid` by platform to avoid colour overplotting; may help reviewers.
8. Reproducibility: set random seed for LOWESS (`sns.regplot` doesn’t need, but be explicit).
9. Memory: copying full `.X` into `a_sub` can double RAM. If adata is big, slice only obs using `adata[mask].copy()` is okay, but consider `.copy()` with `layers=[]` to save memory (optional).
10. PEP-8: put imports at top; avoid single-letter vars like `r`; use `rho` consistently.

Minor stylistic
• Print more informative diagnostics: `print(f"Cells per platform: {a_sub.obs[platform_col].value_counts().to_dict()}")`.
• Wrap code into functions for reuse in later steps.

Adherence to provided package list: satisfied.

Actionable summary
– Re-implement partial Spearman on rank-transformed variables and include intercept.
– Guard against constant vectors in per-platform correlation.
– Tweak LOWESS plotting for clarity.
– Optionally include donor-level stratification or mixed-effects comment in analysis-plan step 1.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/endo_data.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The analysis results present a negative global Spearman correlation between metabolic shift score and cycle day in stromal fibroblasts, with adjusted and platform-specific correlations remaining negative. Given the importance of stromal fibroblasts in endometrial remodeling and decidualization, these results could suggest a relationship between metabolic shifts and cycle progression that needs further exploration.

### Feedback:

1. **Correlation Insights:**
   - The negative correlation, though statistically significant, is weak (ρ = -0.139 globally and slightly improved with platform adjustment). This suggests the relationship might not be biologically significant or might involve more complex interactions than a simple linear relationship.

2. **Platform Differences:**
   - The stronger negative correlation for the 10x platform compared to C1 indicates potential technical or biological differences that should be explored.
   - Consider evaluating platform-specific biases or technical differences that might explain these discrepancies.

3. **Metabolic Shift and Cycle Phase:**
   - The LOWESS plot shows a relatively flat trend, suggesting no significant metabolic shifts correlated with the cycle day.
   - Explore whether other metabolic markers or pathways relevant to stromal fibroblast function might exhibit different patterns.
   - Consider a more granular phase-based analysis rather than continuous cycle days.

4. **Future Iterations:**
   - Incorporate additional biological variables, such as hormone levels, which might modulate stromal changes.
   - Given the complexity of the menstrual cycle, investigate non-linear or interaction effects between cell types, stromal shifts, and signaling pathways.
   - Consider employing machine learning models to identify potential non-linear patterns or complex interactions.

5. **Validation and Further Analysis:**
   - Validate findings with additional datasets or different methodological approaches such as proteomics.
   - Deep dive into gene expression profiles specifically related to decidualization and metabolic pathways to validate hypothesis at the molecular level.

By focusing on complexity beyond linear interpretations, this approach may reveal more insights into stromal fibroblast dynamics throughout the cycle.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
If the apparent global decrease in metabolic-shift with cycle day is biologically relevant, individual donors should display consistently negative slopes of metabolic_shift versus numeric cycle day in stromal fibroblasts; the median donor-specific slope will therefore be < 0.

Analysis Plan:
['For each donor represented by ≥ 20 stromal fibroblast cells (and at least two distinct cycle days), fit a simple linear model metabolic_shift ~ day and record the slope.', 'Visualise the distribution of donor slopes with a box- and strip-plot, marking the zero line.', 'Test whether the median slope differs from zero using a two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test.', 'Next, perform a phase-based (early-, mid-, late-secretory) comparison of metabolic_shift in stromal fibroblasts with a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by post-hoc Dunn pairwise tests (BH-corrected).', 'Finally, repeat the donor-slope analysis for unciliated epithelial cells to assess cell-type specificity of the trend.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:

# ---------------------------------------------
# Donor-specific linear slopes in stromal fibroblasts

sf_mask = adata.obs['cell_type'] == 'Stromal fibroblasts'
sf = adata[sf_mask].copy()

# ensure day is numeric integer
sf.obs['day'] = sf.obs['day'].astype(int)

# 2. collect donor-wise slopes
records = []
for donor, df in sf.obs.groupby('donor'):
    if len(df) < 20 or df['day'].nunique() < 2:
        continue  # skip poorly represented donors
    slope, intercept = np.polyfit(df['day'], df['metabolic_shift'], 1)
    records.append({'donor': donor, 'slope': slope, 'n_cells': len(df)})

donor_slopes = pd.DataFrame(records)

Feedback:
Feedback on analysis plan
• Hypothesis and steps are clear and distinct from the paper and previous macrophage-focused analysis; good focus on donor-level consistency.  
• Step-1 (slopes) and Step-3 (Wilcoxon on slopes) match the hypothesis; Step-4 (phase comparison) and Step-5 (epithelial repeat) nicely extend scope while remaining coherent.  
• Consider adding (a) clear definition of “cycle day” source (histological vs self-reported) and (b) explicit platform adjustment or sensitivity check, since earlier exploratory code showed platform effects.  
• For phase comparison, specify which annotation field (e.g. adata.obs['phase']) you will use, or create it reproducibly from numeric day.  
• Dunn post-hoc requires scipy.stats.posthoc_dunn → not allowed; instead use pair-wise Mann-Whitney with BH correction (or write simple Dunn routine) within allowed packages.  
• State minimum donor count for epithelial repeat to avoid under-powered test.  
• Optionally include mixed-effect model (slope random intercept) as robustness check, but keep within “single core goal” guideline.

Feedback on first-step Python code
Functional
✓ Uses only allowed packages, no file I/O, creates required outputs/plots.  
✓ Correct donor filtering (≥20 cells & ≥2 days) and simple linear fit with np.polyfit.  
✗ Does not protect against NaNs or constant ‘metabolic_shift’; polyfit will raise LinAlgError or return nan slopes. Add try/except and skip donors with var(df['metabolic_shift'])==0.  
✗ Using all cells directly weights donors by cell count at each day. Averaging per-day first (or using ordinary least squares on day-means with n_cells as weights) would avoid unequal cell-sampling bias.  
✗ Wilcoxon fails when all slopes are identical or zero (ValueError); wrap in try/except or drop zero differences beforehand.  
✗ Test is implicitly two-sided (SciPy default) but stating alternative='two-sided' improves clarity.  
✗ No multiple-testing issue here, but note for later steps.

Style & reproducibility
• Add seed to seaborn.stripplot jitter (np.random.seed(0); jitter=True plus dodge seed) for reproducible dots.  
• Prefer scipy.stats.linregress (gives slope, stderr, rvalue) for readability.  
• Store intercept, r², and maybe p-value per donor to aid later meta-analysis.  
• Use .copy() on df in groupby loop only if modifying; not needed here.  
• Avoid chained assignment warning: sf.obs = sf.obs.copy(); or use loc indexing.  
• Figure: add x-labels even though only y plotted, and call sns.despine() for cleaner look.

Minor
• Initial comments mention “basic QC” but code applies none; either remove wording or implement QC filters (e.g. mitochondrial %, n_genes).  
• Ensure ‘day’ is int before subsetting (done). Consider asserting monotonic range (1-28).  
• Variable names: use snake_case consistently (donor_slopes not donorSlopes, fine).  
• Remove unused imports (numpy already imported via polyfit; all fine).

Overall, code is nearly ready; addressing NaN/constant cases, sampling bias, and Wilcoxon robustness will make it safe for all donors.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/endo_data.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

Next step: For stromal fibroblasts, restrict to donors represented by ≥ 20 cells spanning at least two distinct numeric cycle days (adata.obs['day'], histology-based).

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The textual result of "Empty DataFrame" and "Too few informative donors or identical slopes; Wilcoxon skipped" suggests that the recent analysis step did not produce any informative results. This setback may be due to insufficient variation in the data, too few samples to perform a meaningful statistical test, or potentially issues with data quality or processing.

Here are some considerations and feedback to inform future steps of the analysis:

1. **Sample Size and Diversity**: The mention of "too few informative donors" suggests a limitation in the sample size or diversity. It's essential to ensure that a sufficient number of biologically diverse samples are included in the analysis to detect meaningful patterns and correlations. Exploring additional datasets or integrating more donors can enhance data robustness.

2. **Data Quality**: Investigate the input data for quality issues, such as low sequencing depth, batch effects, or other technical confounders that could potentially mask biological signals. Consider strategies like doublet filtering, normalization, and batch correction to improve data quality.

3. **Alternative Statistical Methods**: Since the Wilcoxon test was not feasible due to identical slopes, explore alternative methods that might handle such scenarios, such as mixed models or Bayesian approaches, which can consider hierarchical structure and donor-specific effects.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Revisit exploratory data analysis methods to identify potential issues or patterns. Techniques such as PCA or UMAP could visualize data structure and distribution, providing insights into possible clustering or segmentation that require further investigation.

5. **Gene Set Enrichment**: Instead of focusing solely on global metrics across donors, consider performing gene set enrichment analyses at the individual donor or cycle phase level. This could reveal phase-specific or individual-specific biological processes that inform about menstrual cycle dynamics.

6. **Cross-Platform Validation**: The dataset includes profiles from different platforms (Fluidigm C1 and 10x Chromium). Utilize cross-platform integration methods to leverage both datasets' strengths, potentially leading to more reliable and interpretable conclusions.

7. **Iterative Analysis Framework**: Given past analyses and this current step's result, adopt an iterative analysis approach where assumptions and parameters are revisited and refined based on ongoing results. This can include adjusting thresholds for cell type identification, modifying gene selection criteria, or re-evaluating phase definitions.

By addressing these considerations, the upcoming analysis steps may yield more biologically meaningful and statistically robust results, leading to insights into endometrial dynamics across the menstrual cycle, aligning with the overall hypothesis.
