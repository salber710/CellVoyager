PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi-tools, scVelo, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. If trying to use scVelo, insert the following code snippet BEFORE the "import scvelo" statement:
    import matplotlib
    class mplDeprecation(UserWarning):
        pass
    matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation = mplDeprecation
    11. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    12. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps. 

You are given the following summary of the anndata object:

Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
The paper focuses on severe COVID-19, a condition induced by SARS‑CoV‑2 infection that, in a subset of patients, progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.

Biological background  
Key biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.

Paper’s computational analyses  
A series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: Monocytes in severe COVID‐19 patients exhibit increased transcriptional heterogeneity in their global gene expression profiles compared to healthy individuals. This increased cell‐to‐cell variability (as measured by the coefficient of variation) may indicate a dysregulated inflammatory response and impaired coordination during antigen presentation, potentially contributing to disease immunopathology.

Analysis Plan:
1. Filter the AnnData object to extract monocytes by selecting cells from adata.obs where the 'cell_type_coarse' column contains the term 'Monocyte', thereby including both CD14 and CD16 monocytes.
2. For each monocyte cell, compute a transcriptome-wide coefficient of variation (CV) by calculating the standard deviation divided by the mean expression (with a small constant added to avoid division by zero). This measure serves as an indicator of transcriptional heterogeneity.
3. Visualize the distribution of the CV for monocytes stratified by disease status (COVID versus Healthy) using violin plots. This will provide a clear comparison of variability across the two groups.
4. Perform a statistical test (Mann-Whitney U test) to determine if the differences in CV between monocytes of COVID-19 patients and healthy donors are significant.
5. Expand the analysis by correlating the cell-level CV with additional clinical metadata such as ventilation status to examine potential relationships between transcriptional variability and disease severity.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Feedback:
• The code correctly filters monocytes from the AnnData object and computes the cell‐level coefficient of variation (CV), but it assumes that using the dense expression matrix (via toarray) is acceptable. Consider checking if working on a log‐transformed or normalized dataset might be more appropriate for transcriptional heterogeneity analyses.

• The constant epsilon (1e-8) is a reasonable safeguard, though documenting the rationale for its chosen value would enhance clarity.

• The code for plotting and statistical testing is well implemented. However, note that filtering the 'Status' column by matching the string "b'COVID'" and "b'Healthy'" suggests that the metadata contains byte strings. It might be cleaner to convert these to UTF-8 decoded strings earlier in the analysis to avoid handling the "b'" prefix repeatedly.

• The analysis plan is clearly connected to the overall hypothesis and builds logically on previous steps while being distinct from past analyses. It correctly outlines the steps to compare transcriptional variability between disease states and ultimately relate it to clinical metadata.

• In the plan, ensure that downstream analyses (e.g., correlation with clinical metadata) consider potential confounders such as cell quality metrics. Also, it could be useful to mention any normalization or scaling needed before computing CV, to guarantee consistency across cells.

• Overall, the code follows the guidelines by focusing on the relevant cell type and measures, uses acceptable statistical tests, and the plan proposes clear novel insights into transcriptional heterogeneity in monocytes in severe COVID‐19 versus healthy individuals.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: Monocytes in severe COVID‐19 patients exhibit increased transcriptional heterogeneity in their global gene expression profiles compared to healthy individuals. This increased cell‐to‐cell variability (as measured by the coefficient of variation) may indicate a dysregulated inflammatory response and impaired coordination during antigen presentation, potentially contributing to disease immunopathology.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Step 1: Preprocess the AnnData metadata by decoding byte strings (e.g., in 'cell_type_coarse', 'Status', and other relevant fields) to standard UTF-8 strings. This will simplify downstream filtering and plotting steps.
2. Step 2: Filter the AnnData object to extract monocytes by selecting cells where the decoded 'cell_type_coarse' column contains 'Monocyte' (covering both CD14 and CD16 monocytes).
3. Step 3: Check if the expression data is normalized. If the median expression per cell is high (e.g., median > 50), assume it is raw and apply a log1p normalization to reduce skew before computing the coefficient of variation (CV).
4. Step 4: Compute the cell-level CV for each monocyte by calculating the standard deviation divided by the mean expression across all genes, adding a small constant (epsilon = 1e-8) to avoid division by zero (the epsilon value is chosen to be small enough to not distort the CV while ensuring numerical stability).
5. Step 5: Visualize the distribution of the CV for monocytes stratified by disease status (COVID vs Healthy) using a violin plot. Ensure that the 'Status' metadata is decoded to prevent issues with leading byte markers.
6. Step 6: Carry out a statistical comparison between the CV values of COVID and Healthy monocytes using the Mann-Whitney U test, printing the test statistic and p-value, while considering that downstream analyses (e.g., correlation with clinical metadata) should account for potential confounders like cell quality metrics.

PROMPT: Results Interpretation (user)

Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.\n\nBiological background  \nKey biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.\n\nPaper’s computational analyses  \nThe first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.\n\nPaper’s computational analyses  \nA series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.\n\nPaper’s computational analyses  \nThe authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.\n\nPaper’s dataset description  \nThe dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.\nIn severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.\nIn severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.\n\nPast Analyses Attempted:\n\n\n\n'}]

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Monocytes in severe COVID‐19 may engage in altered cell–cell communication with T cells via dysregulated expression of inflammatory ligands and receptors. Specifically, while previous results revealed significant differences in transcriptional variability, we now hypothesize that, in severe COVID‐19, monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (such as TNF, IL1B, and IL6) and T cells correspondingly upregulate their receptors (TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, and IL6R). This modified communication may further drive immunopathology in affected patients.

Analysis Plan:
["Step 2: Subset the T cell population from the AnnData object using the 'cell_type_coarse' metadata (filtering for values containing 'T') and ensure that their expression data is normalized (using log1p normalization analogous to the monocyte subset).", 'Step 3: Identify key ligand genes in monocytes (TNF, IL1B, IL6) and corresponding receptor genes in T cells (TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). Validate that these genes are present in the dataset.', 'Step 4: For each gene, extract per-cell expression values stratified by disease status (COVID vs Healthy) from the appropriate normalized data layer.', 'Step 5: Visualize the expression distributions using violin plots arranged in a grid (one row for monocyte ligands and one for T cell receptors) and annotate the plots with the results of Mann-Whitney U tests comparing the two groups.', 'Step 6: Interpret the differences in expression of these ligand–receptor pairs to assess how dysregulated intercellular communication might contribute to severe COVID‐19 immunopathology.']

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan Feedback:
  – The hypothesis centers clearly on dysregulated communication between monocytes and T cells via inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs in severe COVID‐19. The plan is well-structured and distinct from previous analyses, focusing on a novel cell–cell communication aspect.
  – Steps 2–6 are logically ordered. However, consider:
    ▪ Explicitly ensuring metadata (like ‘Status’ or ‘cell_type_coarse’) are properly decoded (as in previous analyses) for consistency.
    ▪ Verifying that gene filtering for ligands and receptors is cell-type specific because some genes might be absent or lowly expressed in a given subset.
    ▪ Including additional validation of normalization (e.g. assessing distribution pre‐ and post‑normalization) to avoid potential artifacts.
    ▪ Clarifying the rationale for choosing the median >50 threshold to trigger log1p normalization (especially across different cell types).
    
• Python Code Feedback (Step 2):
  – The initial extraction of T cells using a string “T” in ‘cell_type_coarse’ is straightforward, but be cautious if non‑T cells have “T” in their descriptor; refining the filter (for example, matching “CD4 T” or “CD8 T”) might improve specificity.
  – The conversion of the sparse expression matrix to a dense array is handled properly. Consider wrapping the conversion in a try/except block to catch potential exceptions on very large datasets.
  – The median-based check for applying log1p normalization is a practical heuristic. However, ensure that this threshold is validated on the T cell subset and that the naming of the normalized layer (‘log1p’) is consistent with downstream use.
  – When validating gene presence, the code uses adata.var_names (i.e. the full dataset) rather than the subset for each cell type. Although this is acceptable if the variable names are consistent, consider verifying within each subset to catch any differences.
  – In the extraction of per-gene expression (Step 4), the use of numpy’s np.where and indexing is efficient, but adding error handling in case a gene isn’t found would improve robustness.
  – The visualization section uses a grid of subplots for ligands and receptors with Mann–Whitney U tests. The code is clear; however, consider handling the special case when only one column is present (axes may not be a 2D array) to avoid indexing errors.
  
Overall, the code adheres to the provided guidelines and successfully extends previous analyses without duplication, while implementing the novel hypothesis.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi-tools, scVelo, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. If trying to use scVelo, insert the following code snippet BEFORE the "import scvelo" statement:
    import matplotlib
    class mplDeprecation(UserWarning):
        pass
    matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation = mplDeprecation
    11. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    12. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: next_step

Next step: Step 2: Subset the T cell population from the AnnData object by refining the filter to include only 'CD4 T' and 'CD8 T' (using an exact match rather than a broad 'T' match) and ensure that metadata fields like 'Status' have been properly decoded. Convert the expression matrix from sparse to dense using a try/except block to handle possible large datasets. Assess the raw data distribution (via median expression) and apply log1p normalization if the median exceeds a validated threshold (here, >50). Additionally, optionally visualize the distribution pre‐ and post‑normalization to avoid artifacts.

PROMPT: Results Interpretation (user)

[{'type': 'text', 'text': "You will be given the results of a step in a single-cell transcriptomic analysis.\nYou will be given the hypothesis, analysis plan (which includes the current step and future steps), and the code for the step that outputted the results. \nThis output may be in the form of text, image, both, or neither.\n\nYour role is to provide feedback that helps inform future steps of the analysis and informs whether the hypothesis is validated.\nThis feedback could be in the form of saying which results seem promising, how to further iterate on the promising results, etc.\nJust return your feedback, do not return anything else.\n\nIt is important to note that the purpose of these analyses is to be both biologically meaningful but also to be distinct\nfrom the analyses conducted in the research paper below as well as distinct from previous analyses attempted.\n\nTextual Results:\nMann-Whitney U test: Statistic = 14826772.5, p-value = 1.67004212798891e-32\nT cell median raw expression: 0.0\nLigand genes found in monocytes dataset: ['TNF', 'IL1B', 'IL6']\nReceptor genes found in T cells dataset: ['TNFRSF1A', 'IL1R1', 'IL6R']\nStep 2 complete: T cell subset extracted, normalized, and key receptor genes processed. Visualization with statistical comparisons between COVID and Healthy groups is now complete.\n\n\nResearch Paper:\nBiological background  \nThe paper focuses on severe COVID-19, a condition induced by SARS‑CoV‑2 infection that, in a subset of patients, progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.\n\nBiological background  \nKey biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.\n\nPaper’s computational analyses  \nThe first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.\n\nPaper’s computational analyses  \nA series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.\n\nPaper’s computational analyses  \nThe authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.\n\nPaper’s dataset description  \nThe dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.\nIn severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.\nIn severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.\n\nPast Analyses Attempted:\n\n\n\n"}]

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
While T cells overall showed low expression of the candidate receptor genes, a closer examination of T cell subtypes (using the finer-grained cell type annotation) may reveal a distinct subset with enhanced receptor expression in COVID‐19 patients. This could indicate that only specific T cell subpopulations are engaged in the dysregulated communication with monocytes in severe COVID‐19.

Analysis Plan:
["Step 2: Refine the T cell analysis by leveraging the 'cell_type_fine' metadata to subdivide T cells into distinct subpopulations. Decode the 'cell_type_fine' column if necessary to ensure proper annotation.", 'Step 3: For each T cell subtype, perform a differential expression analysis specifically for the candidate receptor genes (TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R) to compare COVID‐19 and Healthy groups. Use non-parametric tests (i.e., Mann-Whitney U test) if both groups are adequately represented. Annotate each test with its statistics (test statistic and p-value).', 'Step 4: Visualize the receptor gene expression distributions across different T cell subtypes and statuses using grid-assembled violin plots. These plots will help identify any T cell subset that shows unusual receptor upregulation in COVID‐19 patients.', 'Step 5: Summarize the findings to determine if a specific T cell subpopulation could mediate post-transcriptional or translational communication with monocytes, thereby suggesting an alternative mechanism of immune dysregulation.']

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan Feedback:
  - The hypothesis and subsequent steps focus on a novel angle by dissecting T cell heterogeneity using the "cell_type_fine" metadata, which is distinct from previous analyses and the original paper’s approach.
  - The plan is clearly defined, with each step logically building toward the goal of deciphering subtype-specific receptor upregulation.
  - Non-parametric statistics and grid-based violin plots are appropriate for this analysis.
  - Ensure that all necessary metadata (like "Status") is consistently decoded earlier in the workflow (as done for T cells in previous steps) to avoid misinterpretation in downstream comparisons.

• Python Code Feedback for Step 2:
  - The code correctly checks for and decodes the "cell_type_fine" column, ensuring proper subtype annotations.
  - Filtering of receptor genes based on their presence in adata_tcells.var_names is implemented well; however, consider logging a warning or error if none of the receptor genes is found.
  - When extracting expression, the code handles both the presence of a "log1p" layer and raw count matrix. To improve clarity, move the gene index retrieval outside the try‐except block for more precise error reporting.
  - The grid-assembled violin plots are set up nicely, but note that if some subtypes are skipped due to missing statuses, the plotting grid might have unused subplots. Consider dynamically adjusting the grid dimensions or logging which subtypes were excluded.
  - Statistical testing with the Mann–Whitney U test is appropriately applied per receptor and subtype; ensure that sufficient sample sizes are checked to validate test assumptions.
  - The code is self-contained and adheres to the allowed packages, with good use of “copy()” to avoid modifying the original data.
  - Overall, the code is well organized, builds on prior analyses, and aligns perfectly with the new hypothesis and plan. Minor adjustments can improve error handling and subplot management, but the current implementation meets the project guidelines effectively.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi-tools, scVelo, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. If trying to use scVelo, insert the following code snippet BEFORE the "import scvelo" statement:
    import matplotlib
    class mplDeprecation(UserWarning):
        pass
    matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation = mplDeprecation
    11. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    12. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)

Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.\n\nBiological background  \nKey biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.\n\nPaper’s computational analyses  \nThe first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.\n\nPaper’s computational analyses  \nA series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.\n\nPaper’s computational analyses  \nThe authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.\n\nPaper’s dataset description  \nThe dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.\nIn severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.\nIn severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.\n\nPast Analyses Attempted:\n\n\n\n"}]

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current step's results provide an interesting overview of differential expression patterns in T cell receptor genes across different T cell subtypes between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Notably, significant differential expression was observed in CD8m T cells for TNFRSF1A and IL6R, CD4m T cells for TNFRSF1A and IL1R1, and CD4n T cells for TNFRSF1A. These findings suggest possible subtype-specific alterations in receptor expression during severe COVID-19, which aligns with the research paper's focus on dysregulated immune cell interactions in severe disease.

Promising Focus Areas and Suggestions for Future Steps:

1. **Validation of Differential Expression:**
   - For the significant findings, especially TNFRSF1A in CD4n T cells, further validation could involve confirming these expressions using an independent method such as qPCR or flow cytometry if possible. 

2. **Biological Implications:**
   - Investigate the biological meaning of these findings, particularly how increased receptor expression on specific T cell subtypes might correlate with enhanced signaling from monocytes. Examine how these interactions potentially contribute to the cytokine storm or altered immune response in severe COVID-19.

3. **Integration with Cell Communication Analysis:**
   - The hypothesis of increased monocyte-T cell communication via receptor-ligand pairs should be explored further. Utilize complementary computational analyses to predict and model these interactions, such as ligand-receptor interaction databases or cell-cell communication tools like CellPhoneDB or NicheNet.

4. **Comparison with Past Analyses:**
   - Ensure that this analysis distinguishes itself from previous studies by emphasizing subtype-specific insights and associating them with different stages of COVID-19 severity.

5. **Consideration of Clinical Metadata:**
   - Cross-reference these findings with clinical metadata such as patients' severity, treatments, and outcomes to identify potential correlations or variances. Stratifying results based on demographic or clinical characteristics could offer more nuanced insights.
   
Overall, the detected significant differential expressions are promising leads. Coupling this data with advanced analyses of cell-cell interactions could uncover critical pathophysiological mechanisms pertinent to severe COVID-19 and pave the way for potential therapeutic interventions.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
In severe COVID‐19 patients, the enhanced expression of inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) in monocytes and the corresponding upregulation of receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R) in specific T cell subtypes culminate in increased cell–cell communication. This step tests whether average expression levels of ligand–receptor pairs, when aggregated by donor, are more correlated in COVID‐19 patients (especially those with severe clinical features such as ventilation) compared to healthy individuals.

Analysis Plan:
["Step 2: Cell–Cell Communication Analysis by Donor – Using the existing monocyte and T cell subsets, aggregate the expression of inflammatory ligands in monocytes and receptors in T cells on a per-donor basis. Ensure that donor identifiers (e.g., 'Donor_full') and clinical statuses (e.g., 'Status', 'Ventilated', 'Admission') are properly decoded.", 'Step 2.1: For each donor, compute the average (mean) log1p normalized expression of each ligand gene (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) in monocytes and each receptor gene (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R) in T cells.', 'Step 2.2: Separate the donors by disease status (COVID vs Healthy) and, if possible, by additional clinical metadata (e.g., ventilation status).', 'Step 2.3: For each ligand–receptor pair, perform a Spearman correlation analysis between the donor-average ligand expression (monocytes) and receptor expression (T cells) across donors. This will assess whether increased ligand levels in monocytes are associated with enhanced receptor expression in T cells.', 'Step 2.4: Generate scatter plots with regression lines for each ligand–receptor pair, annotated with the Spearman correlation coefficient and p-value for both COVID‐19 and Healthy groups.', 'Step 2.5: Interpret the significance of the correlation coefficients in the context of enhanced cell–cell communication in severe COVID‐19.']

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan Feedback:
 – The hypothesis is clearly defined and the plan logically addresses key steps to evaluate cell–cell communication by donor using average ligand and receptor expression. 
 – Step 2.2 mentions stratifying by additional metadata (e.g., ventilation), but the code only groups by “Status.” Consider incorporating “Ventilated” status or other clinical metadata as additional stratification factors.
 – The plan overall is novel compared to previous analyses and remains focused on the donor-level cell–cell communication aspect.
 – Consider adding corrections for potential confounders at the donor level (e.g., age, sample quality) if data are available.

• Code Feedback:
 – The code appropriately decodes byte strings for metadata and subsets the relevant monocyte and T cell datasets.
 – It correctly filters for available ligand and receptor genes and extracts their log1p-normalized expression from the appropriate layers.
 – Grouping by “Donor_full” and “Status” to compute average expression is well implemented, but as noted in the plan, including “Ventilated” or other clinical variables could strengthen the analysis.
 – While looping over ligand–receptor pairs, plotting each scatter plot one by one works; however, for improved visualization, consider arranging multiple plots into a grid (as suggested in guideline 3) to compare groups side-by-side.
 – Error handling for cases with insufficient donor data is good. Including comments to explain each major code block enhances clarity.
 – The code meets the specified package guidelines and builds on previous analyses without repetition.
 – Overall, the code is clear, modular, and maintainable; future iterations might refactor plotting routines to streamline figure generation.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi-tools, scVelo, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. If trying to use scVelo, insert the following code snippet BEFORE the "import scvelo" statement:
    import matplotlib
    class mplDeprecation(UserWarning):
        pass
    matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation = mplDeprecation
    11. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    12. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
