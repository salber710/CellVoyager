PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi-tools, scVelo, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. If trying to use scVelo, insert the following code snippet BEFORE the "import scvelo" statement:
    import matplotlib
    class mplDeprecation(UserWarning):
        pass
    matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation = mplDeprecation
    11. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    12. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps. 

You are given the following summary of the anndata object:

Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
The paper focuses on severe COVID-19, a condition induced by SARS‑CoV‑2 infection that, in a subset of patients, progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.

Biological background  
Key biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.

Paper’s computational analyses  
A series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.
