PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi-tools, scVelo, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. If trying to use scVelo, insert the following code snippet BEFORE the "import scvelo" statement:
    import matplotlib
    class mplDeprecation(UserWarning):
        pass
    matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation = mplDeprecation
    11. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    12. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps. 

You are given the following summary of the anndata object:

Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
The paper focuses on severe COVID-19, a condition induced by SARS‑CoV‑2 infection that, in a subset of patients, progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.

Biological background  
Key biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.

Paper’s computational analyses  
A series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: In severe COVID-19, we hypothesize that the normal coordinated regulation between interferon response (captured by IFN1 scores) and antigen presentation (captured by HLA1 scores) is disrupted in key immune cell subsets. Specifically, we expect that in COVID patients, the strength and direction of correlation between IFN1 and HLA1 is altered compared to healthy individuals, especially within monocyte and T cell populations.

Analysis Plan:
1. Begin by subsetting the dataset to focus on the most relevant immune cell types—namely, monocytes (CD14 Monocyte and CD16 Monocyte) and T cells (CD4 T and CD8 T)—using the 'cell_type_coarse' metadata, so that the analysis is concentrated on these key populations.
2. Within the subset, stratify the cells based on the 'Status' column into COVID and Healthy groups. This separation allows for a direct comparison of the coordination between IFN1 and HLA1 scores under disease versus control conditions.
3. For each cell type and each condition (COVID and Healthy), compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between the IFN1 and HLA1 scores (both available in adata.obs). This will provide an initial measure of how these two axes of immune regulation are related in each scenario.
4. Apply a statistical test (using Fisher’s z-transformation or a permutation test) to formally assess whether the differences in correlation coefficients between COVID and Healthy groups are statistically significant, thereby providing a quantitative validation of the observed differences.
5. Visualize the findings by generating scatter plots of IFN1 versus HLA1 for each cell type and condition, arranged in a grid. Include regression lines and annotate each plot with the computed correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values to clearly communicate the differences in immune regulation.
6. Summarize and interpret the results, discussing the implications of altered coordination between interferon response and antigen presentation in the context of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19.

Feedback:
Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The hypothesis and plan are clearly defined and distinct from both the paper’s workflow and previous analyses. The step‐wise approach—from subsetting relevant cell types to stratifying by disease status, computing correlations, applying statistical tests, and visualizing results—is logical and focused.
• You may consider adding exploratory analyses (e.g., checking for potential outliers or non‐linear relationships) before computing Pearson correlations, and mention plans for ensuring correlation assumptions are met.
• Although the plan is centered on immune coordination, briefly noting potential confounders (like batch effects or donor variability) and how they might be mitigated would further strengthen the approach.
• The visualization plan (scatter plots with regression lines) is an excellent way to communicate the results; ensure that subsequent steps include clear labeling and annotation for reproducibility.

Feedback on the First Step Python Code:
• The code cleanly subsets the adata object for the chosen cell types and verifies the distribution of IFN1, HLA1, and Status metadata, which aligns well with your first analysis step.
• The groupby summary print-out provides a useful initial overview. As the analysis progresses, consider saving or logging these outputs to track potential trends or anomalies.
• The boxplots for IFN1 and HLA1 across cell types and statuses are an effective way to visually assess score distributions. Ensure that axis labels, titles, and legends remain consistent across figures for clarity.
• Comments are clear and assist in understanding the code’s purpose; however, consider adding a brief note that “adata” is already loaded in memory, consistent with the guidelines.
• Overall, the code adheres to the provided package restrictions and coding guidelines, and sets a solid foundation for the downstream correlation and statistical testing steps.

Overall, both the analysis plan and code are well structured and innovative in their focus on IFN1 and HLA1 coordination. Small enhancements to incorporate exploratory data checks and detailed visual annotations will further improve clarity and robustness.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: In severe COVID-19, we hypothesize that the coordination between interferon response (measured by IFN1 scores) and antigen presentation (measured by HLA1 scores) is disrupted in key immune cell subsets, particularly in monocytes and T cells. We further posit that before computing correlations, exploratory analyses will reveal potential outliers or non-linear relationships, and that donor variability or batch effects may confound the measurements. These factors will be critically examined to ensure that the assumptions underlying Pearson correlation are met, thereby validating any observed differences in correlation strength and direction between COVID patients and healthy individuals.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Subset the dataset to focus on the most relevant immune cell types (CD14 Monocyte, CD16 Monocyte, CD4 T, and CD8 T) using the 'cell_type_coarse' metadata.
2. Perform exploratory data analyses on the subset to assess the distributions of IFN1 and HLA1 scores, check for potential outliers, and evaluate the linearity of their relationship using scatter plots and descriptive statistics.
3. Stratify the subset by the 'Status' column into COVID and Healthy groups to allow for direct comparison.
4. For each cell type and each condition, compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between IFN1 and HLA1 scores, while monitoring the assumptions of Pearson correlation.
5. Apply a statistical test (e.g., using Fisher’s z-transformation or a permutation test) to rigorously compare the correlation coefficients between COVID and Healthy groups, accounting for potential confounders such as donor variability or batch effects.
6. Visualize the results with scatter plots overlaid with regression lines, annotated with correlation coefficients and p-values, ensuring clear labels and consistent formatting.
7. Summarize and interpret the findings to discuss the implications of altered immune regulation in severe COVID-19.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

### Feedback:

#### Key Observations:
1. **IFN1 Expression:**
   - CD14 and CD16 Monocytes show higher mean expression of IFN1 in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. This suggests an interferon response in monocytes during COVID-19.
   - T cells (CD4 and CD8) also show increased IFN1 expression in COVID-19 individuals, though less pronounced than in monocytes.

2. **HLA1 Expression:**
   - CD14 Monocytes in healthy controls exhibit higher mean expression of HLA1 compared to those in COVID-19 patients, indicating potential downregulation in disease.
   - CD16 Monocytes and T cells do not show as dramatic a change, although slight differences exist.

#### Insights for Hypothesis:
- **Hypothesis Alignment:** The increased IFN1 expression in monocytes supports the hypothesis of altered cytokine signaling in COVID-19, potentially contributing to the inflammatory response.
- **Downregulation of HLA1:** The observed downregulation aligns with the known dysregulation of antigen presentation in COVID-19, particularly in monocytes, which may impact immune activation.

#### Steps for Further Analysis:
1. **Gene Set Enrichment & Pathway Analysis:**
   - Perform pathway enrichment on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with IFN1 and HLA1 to validate the involvement of specific pathways in COVID-19 pathology.

2. **Correlation with Clinical Data:**
   - Integrate clinical severity data and patient outcomes to correlate gene expression changes with clinical phenotypes (e.g., ARDS).

3. **Subclustering for Heterogeneity:**
   - Apply UMAP-based subclustering on monocytes and T cells to explore subpopulation-specific responses, particularly focusing on identifying populations with distinct IFN1 expression profiles.

4. **Exploration of Ligand-Receptor Interactions:**
   - Expand analyses to include receptor expression in T cells co-expressed with monocyte ligands to assess potential cell-cell communication pathways.

5. **Validation with Additional Markers:**
   - Verify findings with additional markers for immune activity and HLA dysregulation, considering both gene expression and protein levels.

By focusing on these analyses, you can gain deeper insights into the role of immune cells in severe COVID-19, potentially revealing novel therapeutic targets or immune signatures predictive of disease outcomes.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the relationship between IFN1 and HLA1 is non-linear and more complex than captured by simple linear correlations, and that these nuanced dependencies will differ between immune cell subsets (monocytes vs T cells) and between COVID-19 and healthy statuses. Capturing this non-linearity can reveal differential regulatory interactions that may contribute to the dysregulated immune response in severe COVID-19.

Analysis Plan:
['Stratify the already subsetted data (monocytes and T cells) by cell type (CD14 Monocyte, CD16 Monocyte, CD4 T, and CD8 T) and by disease status (COVID and Healthy).', 'For each subgroup, compute the Spearman correlation coefficient to capture potential non-linear relationships between IFN1 and HLA1 scores.', 'Visualize the relationship in each subgroup by plotting scatter plots overlaid with a locally weighted regression (lowess) curve to better capture non-linear trends and smooth the noise.', 'Tabulate and print the correlation statistics (Spearman rho and p-value) to compare the strength and significance of associations across cell types and conditions.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Using the previously created adata_subset from the first step
cell_types_of_interest = ['CD14 Monocyte', 'CD16 Monocyte', 'CD4 T', 'CD8 T']
statuses = adata_subset.obs['Status'].unique()

# Initialize a list to collect correlation statistics
results = []

for cell_type in cell_types_of_interest:
    for status in statuses:
        subset = adata_subset.obs[(adata_subset.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == cell_type) & (adata_subset.obs['Status'] == status)]
        # Ensure a minimal number of cells to perform the test reliably
        if subset.shape[0] < 10:
            continue
        # Compute Spearman correlation to capture non-linear associations
        rho, pval = stats.spearmanr(subset['IFN1'], subset['HLA1'])
        results.append({"cell_type": cell_type, "Status": status, "Spearman_rho": rho, "p_value": pval, "n_cells": subset.shape[0]})

        # Visualization with regression using lowess smoothing to illustrate non-linear trends
        plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
        sns.regplot(x='IFN1', y='HLA1', data=subset, lowess=True, scatter_kws={'s': 10}, line_kws={'color': 'red'})
        plt.title(f'IFN1 vs HLA1 in {cell_type} ({status})\nSpearman rho: {rho:.2f}, p-value: {pval:.2e}')
        plt.xlabel('IFN1 Score')
        plt.ylabel('HLA1 Score')
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.show()

# Convert the results list into a DataFrame and print the correlation statistics
results_df = pd.DataFrame(results)
print('Spearman correlation results:')
print(results_df)

Feedback:
1. Analysis Plan Feedback:
 • The plan is well-focused on testing non-linear dependencies between IFN1 and HLA1 within immune cell subtypes and disease statuses—a novel perspective relative to previous analyses.
 • Stratifying by both cell type and disease status is appropriate to capture differences between COVID-19 and healthy conditions.
 • Complementing Spearman correlations with lowess regression for visualization nicely targets non-linear relationships.
 • In future steps, consider integrating a grid layout to display multiple subgroup plots simultaneously, which aids visual comparison across groups.
 • The plan could be further strengthened by discussing potential confounders or batch effects and outlining statistical corrections if needed.

2. Code Feedback:
 • The code properly subsets the adata_subset using cell type and status and performs the Spearman correlation with an adequate cell number threshold.
 • Using seaborn’s regplot with the lowess parameter is an effective method to visualize non-linear trends.
 • Instead of generating a separate figure for each subgroup via plt.figure and plt.show inside loops, consider organizing the multiple plots into a grid (using subplots) to improve comparability and aesthetics, as suggested in the guidelines.
 • It would be helpful to encapsulate repetitive tasks (e.g., plotting and computing statistics) into functions to reduce code repetition and enhance clarity.
 • Ensure that column names used (like “cell_type_coarse”) exactly match those in adata.obs, which is observed here.
 • Overall, the code builds logically on previous steps and adheres to the prescribed packages and guidelines.

Overall, both the analysis plan and the code for the first step are focused and appropriate. Minor enhancements, particularly regarding plot organization, could further improve clarity and presentation.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi-tools, scVelo, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. If trying to use scVelo, insert the following code snippet BEFORE the "import scvelo" statement:
    import matplotlib
    class mplDeprecation(UserWarning):
        pass
    matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation = mplDeprecation
    11. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    12. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)



You are given the following summary of the anndata object:

Next step: Stratify the already subsetted data (monocytes and T cells) by detailed cell types (CD14 Monocyte, CD16 Monocyte, CD4 T, and CD8 T) and by disease status (COVID and Healthy).

Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Explicitly define the cell types and statuses to ensure consistent ordering in plots
cell_types_of_interest = ['CD14 Monocyte', 'CD16 Monocyte', 'CD4 T', 'CD8 T']
statuses = ['COVID', 'Healthy']

# Initialize a list to collect correlation statistics
results = []

# Create a grid of subplots with rows = number of cell types and columns = number of statuses
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=len(cell_types_of_interest), ncols=len(statuses), figsize=(12, 16), sharex=False, sharey=False)

# Loop over each cell type and status to compute correlations and generate plots
for i, cell_type in enumerate(cell_types_of_interest):
    for j, status in enumerate(statuses):
        ax = axes[i, j]
        # Subset the data for current cell type and status
        subset = adata_subset.obs[(adata_subset.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == cell_type) & (adata_subset.obs['Status'] == status)]
        
        # Check if there are enough cells to perform analysis reliably
        if subset.shape[0] < 10:

            ax.axis('off')
            continue
        
        # Compute Spearman correlation to assess non-linear associations

        results.append({"cell_type": cell_type, "Status": status, "Spearman_rho": rho, "p_value": pval, "n_cells": subset.shape[0]})
        
        # Plot scatter with lowess smoothing using seaborn's regplot on the provided axis
        sns.regplot(x='IFN1', y='HLA1', data=subset, lowess=True, scatter_kws={'s': 10}, line_kws={'color': 'red'}, ax=ax)

        ax.set_xlabel('IFN1 Score')

The current analysis explores the correlation between HLA class I score and IFN1 score across different immune cells in COVID-19 and healthy individuals. Here are some observations and suggestions:

### Observations:

1. **CD14 and CD16 Monocytes:**
   - Both CD14 (COVID) and CD16 (COVID) monocytes showed a positive correlation between IFN1 and HLA1 scores, with higher significance and correlation in CD16 monocytes (r = 0.27).
   - In healthy controls, CD14 monocytes displayed a strong correlation (r = 0.29), suggesting IFN1 drives HLA1 expression robustly even in non-disease states.

2. **CD4 and CD8 T Cells:**
   - Both CD4 (COVID) and CD8 (COVID) T cells displayed weak positive correlations.
   - CD4 T cells in healthy individuals showed a negligible correlation, indicating disease-specific interactions might be at play.

3. **Significance:**
   - While many correlations are statistically significant, their biological relevance could vary. The stronger correlations in CD16 monocytes, especially in COVID-19 contexts, may suggest differential engagement in immune processes.

### Suggestions for Future Steps:

1. **Deeper Analysis on CD16 Monocytes:**
   - Since these cells exhibit a notable correlation, further analysis—perhaps integrating additional variables like cytokine levels or cellular activation markers—could elucidate mechanisms specific to COVID-19.

2. **Pathway Enrichment and Differential Gene Expression:**
   - Perform pathway enrichment to see which pathways are upregulated in COVID-19 versus healthy. Focus on interferon-stimulated genes and antigen presentation pathways.
   - Conduct differential gene expression analysis on subsets to identify unique markers or changes.

3. **Explore Cell-Cell Communication:**
   - To align with the hypothesis, explore ligand-receptor interactions specifically in monocyte-T cell pairs. Investigate changes in communication dynamics using methods like CellPhoneDB.

4. **Validation in Severe Cases:**
   - It may be informative to see whether results differ significantly with the severity of COVID-19. Stratifying analyses based on severity (e.g., ARDS presence) could reveal critical nuances.

5. **Transcriptomic Trajectories:**
   - Explore RNA velocity or pseudotime analyses to assess dynamic changes in HLA-related expression over disease progression.

These steps should align with the hypothesis regarding enhanced monocyte-T cell interactions and immunopathology in severe COVID-19, adding nuance beyond basic correlation measures.
