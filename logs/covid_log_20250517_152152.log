PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps.

Here are the previous analyses attempted:


Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
The paper focuses on severe COVID-19, a condition induced by SARS‑CoV‑2 infection that, in a subset of patients, progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.

Biological background  
Key biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.

Paper’s computational analyses  
A series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: In severe COVID-19, the relationship between interferon response (IFN1) and antigen presentation (HLA1) in CD16 Monocytes is altered compared to healthy individuals, reflecting a potential dysregulation of interferon signaling and antigen presentation in these cells.

Analysis Plan:
1. Filter the dataset to retain only CD16 Monocyte cells using the 'cell_type_coarse' annotation.
2. Split the CD16 Monocyte subset into two groups based on the 'Status' column: COVID and Healthy.
3. Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between IFN1 and HLA1 expression values within each group to quantify the degree of co-expression.
4. Perform a statistical comparison of the correlation coefficients from the two groups using Fisher's z-transformation to test for a significant difference.
5. Visualize the relationships by generating scatter plots with regression lines for IFN1 vs HLA1 in both COVID and Healthy groups, arranged side-by-side in a grid.
6. Report the computed correlation coefficients and the statistical test results to support or reject the hypothesis.

Initial Code:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import pearsonr
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Subset the AnnData object to get only CD16 Monocytes
cd16_mask = adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'] == 'CD16 Monocyte'

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

plt.show()

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python code for the first analysis step:

• The code cleanly subsets the AnnData object to retain CD16 Monocytes and splits them by 'Status'. It uses allowed packages and builds appropriately on the metadata fields.

• It correctly extracts the IFN1 and HLA1 expression values and computes Pearson correlations with associated p-values.

• The visualization arranges side‐by‐side scatter plots with regression fits; however, consider adding axis labels (“IFN1 Expression”, “HLA1 Expression”) and correlation annotations directly on each plot for clarity.

• It would be wise to add simple error handling or checks (e.g., ensuring that each group has sufficient cells) before running the Pearson correlation, as small groups might yield unreliable statistics.

Feedback on the overall analysis plan:

• The plan is clearly structured and directly addresses the hypothesis by comparing the relationship between IFN1 and HLA1 in COVID versus Healthy CD16 Monocytes, which is novel relative to previous analyses in the paper.

• The step‐by‐step breakdown (subsetting, splitting, correlation analysis, Fisher's z-transformation for comparing correlations, and visualization) is logical and focused on a single core goal.

• Future implementation should ensure that the Fisher's z-transformation and statistical test results are clearly printed and visualized in a reproducible and self-contained manner.

• Consider integrating potential quality control measures (e.g., filtering cells with extremely low or high counts) if needed to improve robustness of the correlation analysis.

Overall, the code conforms to the provided guidelines, and the analysis plan is well-justified and distinct from prior work, while remaining focused on the hypothesis.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /scratch/users/salber/Single_cell_atlas_of_peripheral_immune_response_to_SARS_CoV_2_infection.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.

Here is a summary of the core single-cell analyses available.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: In severe COVID-19, the relationship between interferon response (IFN1) and antigen presentation (HLA1) in CD16 Monocytes is altered compared to healthy individuals, potentially reflecting dysregulated interferon signaling and antigen presentation mechanisms specific to this cell type.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Filter the AnnData object to retain only CD16 Monocyte cells using the 'cell_type_coarse' annotation.
2. Split the CD16 Monocyte subset into two groups based on the 'Status' column: COVID and Healthy, and check that each group has a sufficient number of cells for reliable statistics.
3. Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between IFN1 and HLA1 expression values within each group, including simple error handling if a group is too small.
4. Add regression scatter plots with clear axis labels and correlation annotations on each plot.
5. Perform Fisher's z-transformation to statistically compare the correlations between groups in subsequent steps, ensuring results are printed and visualized reproducibly.
6. Report the computed correlation coefficients and p-values to support or reject the hypothesis.
