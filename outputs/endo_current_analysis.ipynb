    "- For selected cell types (Unciliated epithelia, Stromal fibroblasts, and Endothelia), group cells by day of sampling and compute a measure of transcriptional dispersion (for example, the coefficient of variation or average dispersion computed over HVGs) for each group.\n",
    "- Visualize the temporal trends of dispersion for each cell type using line plots arranged in a grid, allowing direct comparison of trends and accounting for platform-specific effects.\n",
    "- Perform statistical testing (e.g., Spearman correlation or linear regression) to assess the significance of dispersion changes over the menstrual cycle, and print the test results for interpretation.\n",
