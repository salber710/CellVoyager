    "## Steps:\n",
    "1. Step 1: Preprocess the AnnData metadata by decoding byte strings (e.g., in 'cell_type_coarse', 'Status', and other relevant fields) to standard UTF-8 strings. This will simplify downstream filtering and plotting steps.\n",
    "2. Step 2: Filter the AnnData object to extract monocytes by selecting cells where the decoded 'cell_type_coarse' column contains 'Monocyte' (covering both CD14 and CD16 monocytes).\n",
    "3. Step 3: Check if the expression data is normalized. If the median expression per cell is high (e.g., median > 50), assume it is raw and apply a log1p normalization to reduce skew before computing the coefficient of variation (CV).\n",
    "4. Step 4: Compute the cell-level CV for each monocyte by calculating the standard deviation divided by the mean expression across all genes, adding a small constant (epsilon = 1e-8) to avoid division by zero (the epsilon value is chosen to be small enough to not distort the CV while ensuring numerical stability).\n",
    "5. Step 5: Visualize the distribution of the CV for monocytes stratified by disease status (COVID vs Healthy) using a violin plot. Ensure that the 'Status' metadata is decoded to prevent issues with leading byte markers.\n",
    "6. Step 6: Carry out a statistical comparison between the CV values of COVID and Healthy monocytes using the Mann-Whitney U test, printing the test statistic and p-value, while considering that downstream analyses (e.g., correlation with clinical metadata) should account for potential confounders like cell quality metrics.\n"
