Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a significant global health issue, ranking as the 16th most common malignancy worldwide with high mortality. Specifically, OSCC of the gingivo-buccal region (OSCC-GB) is the most prevalent cancer among men in India and sixth among women. OSCC-GB is strongly associated with tobacco chewing habits, often presents at advanced stages (III/IV), and has a high rate of loco-regional failure, contributing to a poor prognosis. Like many cancers, OSCC displays considerable cellular heterogeneity, encompassing diverse cell types with distinct genomic, epigenomic, and phenotypic features within the tumor microenvironment. This heterogeneity is considered a key factor influencing tumor progression, response to treatment, treatment failure/recurrence, and patient survival. While recent single-cell transcriptomic studies have explored heterogeneity in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), particularly focusing on tongue cancer or comparing HPV-positive and HPV-negative cases, the specific intratumor cellular heterogeneity of OSCC-GB remains largely uncharacterized. Previous bulk sequencing studies indicated notable differences in gene expression profiles between tongue cancer and OSCC-GB. Furthermore, some OSCC-GB cases arise in conjunction with a precancerous lesion known as oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), but the cellular features specific to these tumors are not well understood. This study aims to use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the landscape of cellular diversity and identify novel aspects of heterogeneity in cell types and cell states within OSCC-GB tumors, including those with concomitant OSMF.
