Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: {available_packages}. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is {adata_path}
    10. If trying to use scVelo, insert the following code snippet BEFORE the "import scvelo" statement:
    import matplotlib
    class mplDeprecation(UserWarning):
        pass
    matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation = mplDeprecation
    11. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    12. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
