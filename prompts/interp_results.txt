You will be given the results of a step in a single-cell transcriptomic analysis.
You will be given the hypothesis, analysis plan (which includes the current step and future steps), and the code for the step that outputted the results. 
This output may be in the form of text, image, both, or neither.

Your role is to provide feedback that helps inform future steps of the analysis and informs whether the hypothesis is validated.
This feedback could be in the form of saying which results seem promising, how to further iterate on the promising results, etc.
Just return your feedback, do not return anything else.

It is important to note that the purpose of these analyses is to be both biologically meaningful but also to be distinct
from the analyses conducted in the research paper below as well as distinct from previous analyses attempted.
