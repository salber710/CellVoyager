## Report on Sex-Specific Transcriptional Profiles in COVID-19 Patients

### Core Hypothesis

The core hypothesis of this study is that male and female patients with COVID‐19 exhibit distinct transcriptional profiles in key peripheral immune cells, specifically CD14 Monocytes, CD16 Monocytes, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells. We hypothesized that male cells will display an augmented pro-inflammatory transcriptional signature relative to female cells, potentially explaining observed differences in disease outcomes.

### Analysis Procedure

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Metadata columns such as 'Status', 'cell_type_coarse', 'Sex', and 'Donor_full' were cleaned to remove byte-string artifacts and ensure consistency.
   - COVID-19 samples were selected based on the cleaned 'Status' column.

2. **Cell Type Subsetting:**
   - Peripheral immune cells were subset into monocytes (CD14, CD16) and T cells (CD4, CD8).

3. **Gene Selection:**
   - Ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R) were identified in the dataset.

4. **Expression Analysis:**
   - Donor-level average gene expression was computed for selected ligands in monocytes and receptors in T cells.
   - Data was merged to analyze potential interactions between these cell types.

5. **Correlation and Statistical Testing:**
   - Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for ligand-receptor pairs by sex.
   - Severity of COVID-19 infection was inferred from admission status, allowing stratification of transcriptomic profiles by disease severity and sex.

### Key Findings

- **Transcriptional Differences:**
  - Only male data was available for analysis. Male patients showed varying Pearson correlations for ligand-receptor interactions:
    - TNF and TNFRSF1A: r = -0.47, p = 0.238
    - IL1B and IL1R1: r = -0.24, p = 0.572
    - IL6 and IL6R: r = 0.52, p = 0.190
   
- **Severity and Transcriptional Profiles:**
  - Differences in IL6 expression in monocytes and IL6R expression in T cells were analyzed in relation to illness severity (e.g., ICU vs. floor admission). No statistically significant differences were detected for males (p-values in all tests were > 0.05).

### Implications

The data suggests potential sex-based differences in transcriptional profiles specific to male patients, particularly in the context of ligand-receptor interactions in peripheral immune cells. However, due to the lack of female data, a comprehensive analysis across sexes could not be conducted. The study highlights the need for further analysis with balanced data sampling to elucidate gender-based differences in pro-inflammatory responses and their impact on COVID-19 disease severity.

Future work may focus on expanding data collection, particularly among female patients, and exploring additional cell types or molecular pathways important in COVID-19 pathogenesis. These steps are critical for developing sex-specific therapeutic strategies.
